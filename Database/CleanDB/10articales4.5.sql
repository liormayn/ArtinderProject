The prime minister takes on the judiciary
ISRAELS Supreme Court has long been a solid pillar of the Jewish state s democracy, holding to account governments of all political stripes. But as the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, puts the finishing touches to his fourth coalition after an election in March, he is preparing for an unprecedented fight to muzzle the court. The outcome of the contest—between politicians and judges, and between nationalist and universal values—could tear his government apart, and determine the future character of Israeli politics.

A new coalition is likely to be agreed on in the next few days. Five of its six parties are committed to vote for new legislation that would fulfil the long-held aspiration of right-wing and religious parties to limit the Supreme Courts power to strike down laws passed by the Knesset.

Mr Netanyahu favours an “override clause”, under which the court could overturn laws only if eight or more judges vote to do so (currently a simple majority of the bench, for big cases usually 11 judges from a total of 15, is needed). Even then the Knesset would be able to push the law through with another vote. He also plans to expand the judicial appointments committee, which chooses all of Israel s judges. By adding a minister and an additional Knesset member to the existing nine-strong committee, politicians would gain the upper hand; the legal profession currently has a majority, with three Supreme Court justices and two members of the bar association. The change could open the way for the government to pack the court.

Just how interventionist the Israeli Supreme Court has been is open to debate. Some civil-rights groups think it is too timid, especially on security-related issues. In a landmark decision in 1992, the court opposed the mass expulsion of 415 Hamas members to Lebanon; but after a 14-hour pause it allowed the government to proceed. Two weeks ago, in another decision that angered the left, the court upheld a law that allows cases to be brought against Israelis who call for any form of boycott against Israel and its settlements in the West Bank. The court, however, struck down a clause allowing compensation to be awarded without proof of damage.

But such rulings in favour of the government and security forces have not endeared the court to the right. Likud and its allies were incensed by two rulings in recent years that struck down laws allowing the authorities to hold African migrants in long-term detention without trial. The ultra-Orthodox parties see the court as a secular enemy, because of its rulings on issues of state and religion—including a judgment that yeshiva students should not be exempt from serving in the army.

The biggest obstacle before Mr Netanyahu is the second-largest partner in his proposed coalition, the centrist Kulanu Party, which opposes his changes. Without Kulanu s ten members, the prime minister has only 57 votes, four short of a majority. In discussions this week Mr Netanyahu made it clear that he was resolved to pursue his campaign. One option is to keep up the pressure on Kulanu s leader, Moshe Kahlon, the intended finance minister, to accept judicial changes in return for greater freedom to reform the economy.

Ironically, Likud was historically the party of both Jewish nationalism and deep respect for the judiciary. Its first leader, Menachem Begin, was admiringly (though mistakenly) quoted by followers as accepting an unfavourable ruling with the words “there are judges in Jerusalem!”

Today Likud is run by a leader who has sworn to break the power of the “old elites” and whose colleagues see the Supreme Court judges as remnants of a privileged left-wing establishment which disregards Jewish values in favour of secular and universal principles. The struggle to limit the powers of the Supreme Court is part of a broader contest over the nature of Israel—pitting religious and nationalist activists against advocates of a more liberal and secular-minded country.

There are a few survivors of the old Likud spirit. One is Mr Netanyahu s rival, President Reuven Rivlin. On April 29th Mr Rivlin made a rare political intervention by criticising the new proposals, saying “we have to ensure a strong democracy.” The Supreme Court s president, Miriam Naor, also departed from protocol, declaring that “the court is the last barrier preventing harm to human dignity and other basic rights. It is one of the reasons Israel is seen as a member of the family of democratic nations.” What she might have added is that, with Israel facing potential indictments for war crimes at the International Criminal Court, it can ill afford to tarnish the image of its Supreme Court.

(CNN)Police rescued a 101-year-old man from under the rubble of his home on Saturday, one week after an earthquake hit his country, Nepal Police spokesman Kamal Singh Bam told CNN.

The elderly man is in stable condition and police do not know how he survived or the extent of his injuries. He was rescued in Nuwakot district, just northwest of the capital, Kathmandu.

The death toll from the devastating magnitude-7.8 earthquake that struck Nepal last weekend stands at 7,250, and the number of people injured is 14,122, according to the National Emergency Operation Center.
A Nepalese government minister warned Sunday that the death toll is expected to climb "much higher."

"There are still villages where we know that all houses have been destroyed, but have not yet been able to reach," Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat said at an event in Baku, Azerbaijan.

Mahat portrayed a desperately bleak situation in his comments at an event on the sidelines of an Asian Development Bank meeting.

"It is with great pain and sadness that I stand before you to present the case of my country Nepal which now remains devastated," he said, according to a transcript of his remarks posted on the bank s website.

Mahat said the quake had caused "incalculable human loss and suffering, with millions of people rendered homeless."

"The aftershocks have not receded and we expect the final casualty numbers to climb much higher," he said.

His government warned Saturday that the chances of finding survivors buried in rubble are "extremely slim."

"It will be a miracle if anyone is found alive," Home Ministry spokesman Laxmi Dhakal said. "But we have not completely given up yet and are continuing to look."

The United Nations estimates that more than 3 million people are in need of food assistance -- and nearly half of those need it immediately. Emergency funding of $415 million is needed, the United Nations said.

Mahat said the quake had completely or partially destroyed nearly 300,000 houses.

He said Nepalis would rebuild their nation and come out of the crisis stronger, but not without help from other countries.

"We need your technical advice, global knowhow and importantly, substantial financial resources to propel us," he said.

JERUSALEM — An Israeli airstrike killed members of an armed squad that was preparing to bomb Israeli forces on Sunday along the Israeli-Syrian frontier in the Golan Heights, the Israeli military said.

The Israeli news media said that three or four men were killed in the missile strike. A spokeswoman for the Israeli military said the armed squad had crossed from the Syrian side into the Israeli-controlled part of the contested territory, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 war. Israel did not immediately identify the men, and it was not clear if they were Syrians or belonged to the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah.
This latest flare-up along the increasingly tense cease-fire line came after reports in the Arabic news media of Israeli airstrikes in recent days. One was reported to be against Syrian Army bases in the Qalamoun region near Syria s border with Lebanon, where Hezbollah apparently stored long-range missiles, and another on a Hezbollah convoy that was transporting weapons.

Israel has not commented on these reports over the weekend, which were by the news networks Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya. Instead it maintained a policy of ambiguity, as it has in at least half a dozen similar cases in the last couple of years, in the hope of avoiding retaliation. Hezbollah has also remained silent.

Israel has repeatedly stated that it has no intention of getting involved in Syria s civil war. But in a speech earlier Sunday at military headquarters in Tel Aviv, Israel s defense minister, Moshe Yaalon, reiterated the country s policy of preventing the transfer of sophisticated weaponry to Hezbollah, a Shiite movement backed by Iran. Israel and Hezbollah fought a monthlong war in Lebanon in 2006.

“Iran continues to try to arm Hezbollah, even now, and aspires to equip the Lebanese terrorist organization with advanced and accurate weaponry,” Mr. Yaalon said. “We will not allow the transfer of quality weapons to terrorist organizations, first among them Hezbollah, and we know how to reach it and those behind it anytime, anywhere.”

Specifically, Israel has vowed to prevent the transfer of ground-to-air and shore-to-ship missiles, and of Hezbollah s longer-range ground-to-ground missiles. Israeli analysts say that the sporadic airstrikes will not halt the flow of weapons.

Israel has accused Iran of helping Hezbollah set up a militant network on the Syrian side of the lines in the Golan Heights, with the aim of attacking Israeli targets. In January an Israeli airstrike in the Syrian portion of the strategic plateau killed six Hezbollah fighters, including the son of the group s military commander, who was himself killed in 2008, and an Iranian general. Days later, in sharp retaliation, Hezbollah antitank missiles killed two Israeli soldiers as they drove in a disputed area along the Lebanese border.

Other airstrikes in Syrian territory that were attributed to Israel have gone unanswered, but the once-quiet cease-fire line in the Golan Heights has been increasingly destabilized by the Syrian civil war. There have been exchanges of fire across the line and occasional bomb attacks on Israeli military patrols.

(CNN)Just one day old -- and its time for Britains royal baby to meet the family.

A spokesperson for the British royals said the UKs newest princess would meet her aunt Pippa Middleton and her grandmother Carol Middleton on Sunday. Her grandfather Michael Middleton also arrived at Kensington Palace by car.

The little princess was born Saturday to general jubilation. She weighed 8 pounds, 3 ounces and was healthy, as was her mother, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, also known as Kate. Her father, Prince William, was with his wife at the hospital.

The baby s name has yet to be announced but the odds favor Charlotte and Alice, according to gaming site Ladbrokes.
The day a princess was born 02:30
Carol Middleton is the mother of the Duchess of Cambridge and also of Pippa Middleton, who will be known henceforth as Auntie Pippa.

A spokesperson for Kensington Palace, the official London residence of Price William and Catherine, said Sunday that this is the first time the Middletons, Carol and Pippa, will meet the princess. Reports that the Middletons were at Kensington Palace yesterday were false, the spokesperson said.

Also on Sunday, Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, visited William, Kate and the new princess at Kensington Palace.

The new princess was born on Saturday morning. "Her Royal Highness and her child are both doing well," Kensington Palace tweeted after the birth.	
The newborn princess is fourth in line for the British throne, behind her grandfather Charles, the Prince of Wales; her father, Prince William; and her brother, Prince George, who was born in July 2013.

An easier time than her brother?
In some ways, William and Catherine s newborn daughter will have an easier time than her brother "because no one thinks shes going to be queen," according to Kate Williams, a royal historian.

As a girl, though, she may face different types of scrutiny than would a boy -- regarding, perhaps, what shes wearing and how her hair looks -- much as her mother has, Williams said.

"Its going to be very, very difficult to give her a real, private normal childhood like Kate Middleton had, simply because (shes) a huge celebrity," Williams told CNN.

Now that the world has had its first glimpse of the new princess, speculation has turned to her name. And a lot of speculation there is.

On the day of her birth, Alice, Charlotte and Olivia led the top three spots on betting websites. There has been some speculation, too, that she will be named after her late grandmother, Princess Diana.

If Georges full name is anything to go by, the answer might be all of the above. The toddlers full name is Prince George Alexander Louis of Cambridge.

George and his baby sister may use "Cambridge" as a last name when they attend school in a few years.

TEL AVIV — Uri Muallem, 30, had been drinking when he stepped out of a family gathering at a wedding hall in 2010 to relieve himself on the sidewalk. That was when his encounter with the police began.

A slight man, barely 5 feet tall, Mr. Muallem, from the Tel Aviv suburb of Rishon Lezion, said three burly officers fired pepper spray into his eyes and handcuffed him. He then spent three days in jail and was sentenced to four months of community work “for attacking a police officer,” he said.

Eli Malassa, 33, from the desert town of Netivot in southern Israel, recalled that when he was performing his compulsory military service about 15 years ago, a police officer accused him of stealing the uniform he was wearing and beat him.

Both men came to Israel from Ethiopia with their families in 1991 on a secret airlift known as Operation Solomon, which brought 14,000 Ethiopian Jews to Israel within 36 hours and was cause for an outpouring of national celebration at the time.

On Sunday, Mr. Muallem and Mr. Malassa joined thousands of young Ethiopian-Israelis and sympathizers in a demonstration that blocked main thoroughfares of Tel Aviv, paralyzing the heart of the city for hours. On Sunday evening, the demonstration took a violent turn, with protesters hurling stones and clashing with the police in Rabin Square. Officers responded with stun grenades and water canons, according to the police.

A similar demonstration in Jerusalem on Thursday ended much the same way after protesters hurled stones and bottles at the police. Some here are dubbing the cry of this young, angry generation of Ethiopian-Israelis as Israel s Baltimore or Ferguson, Mo., referring to the tensions that have roiled those cities against the backdrop of frictions between African-Americans and the police.

The trigger for the rage now spilling onto Israel s streets came just over a week ago, when a police officer was caught on a security camera beating an Ethiopian-Israeli soldier in uniform in the city of Holon, in the Tel Aviv suburbs, for no apparent reason.

“Enough of racism, enough of violence!” the crowd in Tel Aviv chanted, the words rhyming in Hebrew. “A violent police officer should be in prison,” they shouted. Some raised Israeli flags or crossed their fists in the air. During the initial, peaceful part of the demonstration, the police halted traffic and looked on as activists including Mr. Muallem, wearing fashionably ripped jeans with his long hair slicked back, sat down in the middle of a main junction during what should have been the afternoon rush hour.

In an effort to restore calm, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel said he would hold a meeting on Monday with representatives of the Ethiopian community, including the soldier who was beaten, Damas Pakado. Mr. Netanyahu said the meeting would also be attended by the nation s police chief and representatives of several ministries, including Internal Security, Social Welfare and Immigrant Absorption.

The police chief, Yohanan Danino, has already announced that the officer filmed beating Mr. Pakado has been fired. He also established a team made up of police representatives and Ethiopian community leaders that will try to establish better relations by first examining complaints against the police.

Guy Ben-Porat, an associate professor in the department of public policy and administration at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, has been researching relations between the police and different sectors of Israeli society for the past three years. He said that Ethiopian-Israelis perceive themselves, much like African-Americans in the United States, as suffering from “overpolicing,” including racial profiling; being stopped and arrested more often than other, “white” Israelis; and being treated with a tougher hand.

“Ethiopian-Israeli citizens strongly believe that they are discriminated against and harassed,” Mr. Ben-Porat said. “Young Ethiopian males in particular feel the police are out to get them and that they wont get justice,” he added.

The Israeli correction authorities do not provide ethnic or racial breakdowns of prisoners, but Ethiopian activists recently told a parliamentary committee that about 30 percent of the juveniles in Israeli prisons were of Ethiopian descent. A government official who asked not to be named to discuss a politically sensitive topic said the figure was actually about 15 percent to 20 percent. Yet that is still disproportionately high considering that Ethiopian-Israelis make up less than 2 percent of the country s population of about 8 million.

Micky Rosenfeld, a spokesman for the Israeli police, rejected the accusations of police racism and comparisons to Baltimore or Ferguson.

The current protest was “understandably” focusing on the police, he said, after the broad publicity given to the beating of the soldier. “But this is not a police issue. There are social and economic issues,” Mr. Rosenfeld added.

This is not the first time that this generation of Ethiopians who were born or grew up in Israel have taken to the streets. In 2012, Ethiopian activists set up a protest tent outside the prime minister s residence in Jerusalem to draw attention to what they described as unofficial racism and discrimination in Israeli society. Ethiopians do not have their own political party, though a few have been elected to Parliament. In the Knesset that was elected in March, a member of the governing Likud Party is of Ethiopian descent.

Still, despite significant government resources allocated to aid their integration, young Ethiopian-Israelis said they were still struggling to be accepted.

“We are not our parents generation, who remained silent,” said Dana Sibaho, 29, a bookkeeper from Netivot who participated in Sunday s protest. “We are the generation that wont remain silent any longer,” she said. “The time has come to take our rights, by force if need be.”

Who were the big winners of the 2015 NCAA basketball tournament?
Even if you didn’t fill out a March Madness bracket this year, you have probably heard the buzz about NCAA’s basketball tournament. Each year, fans take an emotional rollercoaster ride of highs and lows as they watch their favorite college teams compete for the coveted championship title. This year was no different as the tournament came to an exciting close on April 6th and 7th. On Monday night in Indianapolis, Indiana, Duke University’s men’s team beat the University of Wisconsin’s team with a score of 68-53.On Tuesday night, in Tampa, Florida, the University of Connecticut’s (UConn) women’s team beat the University of Notre Dame 63-53.

For UConn’s head coach Geno Auriemma, this year’s win marked his 10th NCAA Tournament title in the past 20 years. He is now tied for the most titles in college basketball with University of California, Los Angeles head coach John Wooden. “What we have done here in the last 20 years is pretty remarkable in its own right,” Auriemma said after the win.

For Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski, who has lead the team for 35 years, it was the fifth championship in nine trips his team has made to the title game. "It was heaven," Krzyzewski said of the stadium where he is now 4-0 in Final Fours.

Freshman Fever

The Duke Blue Devils beat the Wisconsin Badgers 68-53 and took home their fifth national championship in school history. Wisconsin had a nine-point lead with 13:23 remaining, but freshman guard Grayson Allen led Duke back. He hit a three-pointer then grabbed a three-point play on Duke’s next two possessions to cut Wisconsin’s lead to three.

Wisconsin took a 58-56 lead with 4:25 to go, but the Blue Devils responded with a 10-0 run. Badgers Frank Kaminsky, nicknamed “Big Frank” for his 6’11 frame, was the national player of the year going into the game. The power forward scored 21 points and 11 rebounds while his All-America match-up, Duke’s Jahlil Okafor, was limited to 10 points and three rebounds.

Senior Tyus Jones finished with 23 points and was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four, while Allen had a break-through performance with 16 points. “It was fun to watch my teammates do what they do,” Okafor said. “They have my back the entire season, and it was no different tonight.”

Hungry for More

Coach Geno Auriemma and his team of “Hungry Huskies” outplayed Notre Dame to clinch UConns third straight title. Junior Breanna Stewart added 15 rebounds and eight points for her unstoppable team. The two-time AP Player of the Year has saved her best games for when the lights shined their brightest. She became the first woman to achieve the honor of being named most outstanding player of the Final Four three times in a row. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is the only men s player to have done it.

There just hasnt been a player like Stewie in the women s game in a long, long time," Auriemma said. "She’s the kind of player that women s basketball probably hasnt seen."

Stewart stated when she came to UConn that her goal was to win four championships. She is now one title away from reaching that goal. She broke down on the podium with tears streaming down her face. 

"I think its really surreal and I havent had a chance to even think about that," said Stewart wearing the championship net around her neck. "I have won three national championships, but said I wanted to win four, you cant win four without winning three first."

The Roberto Clemente Award honors baseball stars for their work on and off the field

In October, baseball fans cheer for America s top teams battling to win the World Series. But its not just the winning team that gets a prize. Major League Baseball presents many other honors at the games. One is the Roberto Clemente Award, named after the first Hispanic player elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. The trophy is given each year to a player with outstanding sportsmanship, skill, and community service.
Super Sluggers

Each of the 30 teams nominates one player for the award every year. Fans vote online for their top choice. The winner of the fan vote gets one vote. Judges, including Vera Clemente, who married the baseball legend in 1964, then vote, too. “I help Mom understand how long the players have been in the major leagues but I leave her alone when it comes to voting,” Clementes son Roberto Jr. told TFK. “Her heart tells her and she s been on point every single year.”

This years nominees include Chicago White Sox infielder Paul Konerko, Jimmy Rollins, who plays shortstop for the Philadelphia Phillies, and pitcher Felix Hernandez of the Seattle Mariners. Konerko, who played his final game on September 28 after 18 years in the major leagues, helped create the Bring Me Home campaign. The program helps children in foster care. In foster care, children are placed in safe, temporary homes during a time when their parents are unable to care for them. Rollins started J-Rolls Aces and J-Rolls Readers. Both programs help students who live in poor areas of Philadelphia. Hernandez teamed up this year with Seattle rapper Macklemore to start the #ChangetheGame anti-bullying campaign. The program asks kids to sign a pledge that encourages them to be kind.

A Home-Run Hero

Roberto Clemente was born in Carolina, Puerto Rico, in 1934. He played as an outfielder for the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1955 to 1972. He was the National League batting champ four times. His 3,000 hits included 240 home runs. On December 31, 1972, Clemente died in a plane crash. He was on his way to Nicaragua, to deliver supplies to earthquake victims.

Roberto Jr. has many memories of his father. “If kids were playing in a playground, he would stop his car and start playing ball with them,” he recalls. “He was privileged to play a game that he loved but he used that as a vehicle to help other people.” Roberto Jr. and his family are honored that Major League Baseball gives an award in his fathers name to an outstanding player. Says Roberto Jr., “The legacy is stronger today than it was 40 years ago.” This year s winner will be announced before one of the World Series games.

Against all odds, underdog Israeli basketball team defeats Real Madrid 98-86.
Israel s Maccabi Electra Tel Aviv basketball team defeated Real Madrid 98-86 and won the Euroleague championship game in Milan on Sunday evening. This is the club s sixth European championship title.

Maccabi entered the final an underdog, with few expecting it to get into the Final Four, never mind to go all the way and win the championship.

Tyrese Rice led Maccabi with 26 points - 14 in overtime. Ricky Hickman netted18 points, Devin Smith 15 and 7 rebounds, and David Blu finished with 14 points.

Some 10,000 yellow-and-blue fans traveled to Italy for the Final Four tournament.

It secured its place in the Final Four with a stunning 86-66 home win over Emporio Armani Milan, completing a 3-1 victory in their best-of-five quarter-final series.

Then, in the semi-final last Friday night, Maccabi came from behind to defeat the heavily-favored CSKA Moscow by a last-second basket, after CSKA had been up by 15 points late in the game.

Even coach David Blatt admitted after the semi-final that Maccabi had overshot every possible expectation during the season. When asked if the sky is the limit, Blatt said that in this storm of a season, Maccabi long ago touched the sky and reached the moon.

CSKA s advantage in funding, height, depth and talent was overwhelming– and the figures from the game spoke for themselves.

Maccabi was outrebounded 43-30; it reached the foul line only 6 times, scoring only half of those; its field goal percentage inside the arch was 45 precent, compared to CSKA s 56 precent; it got very little production out of two of its most promising players (Schortsanitis had 4 points in 14 minutes and Ingles had 2 in 15).

If Blatt had seen those figures before the game, he would have thrown in the towel. According to the known rules of basketball, these are the stats of a loser. But as we have learned before, Maccabi is operating under different laws this season.

Swimming is an activity that burns lots of calories, is easy on the joints, supports your weight, builds muscular strength and endurance, improves cardiovascular fitness, cools you off and refreshes you in summer, and one that you can do safely into old age. In this article, Ill review the history of swimming, the benefits, the strokes, how to get started, what to wear, equipment you need, where to do it, and more.


What is the history of swimming?

Human beings have been swimming for millennia. According to Wikipedia, Stone Age cave drawings depict individuals swimming and there are written references in the Bible and the Greek poems "The Iliad" and "The Odyssey" dating back 1,500 to 2,000 years. There are even Egyptian clay seals from 4000 BC showing four swimmers doing a version of the crawl, and the most famous swimming drawings were apparently found in the Kebir desert and were estimated to also be from around 4000 BC.

According to the Encyclopedia of Traditional British Rural Sports, literature specifically related to swimming grew in the middle ages. It is believed that the first book devoted to swimming was Colymbetes by Nicolas Wynman written in 1538, and a more widely recognized text, De Arte Nantandi, was published in Latin by Everard Digby in 1587. The encyclopedia also reports that swimming was required of knights and that Romans built bathhouses and pools wherever they conquered to serve as social clubs and places to exercise.

Organized swimming began in the 1800s and 1900s with the creation of swimming associations (for example, the Amateur Swimming Association in 1886) and clubs that competed against each other. There are reports from that era of swimming clubs in England, France, Germany, and the United States. High-profile events also contributed to swimming s visibility. For instance, Matthew Webb swam the English Channel in 1875.

Competitive swimming continued to grow in popularity during the 1800s and was included in the first modern Olympic Games in Athens in 1896. In 1904, the Olympics in St. Louis included the 50-, 100-, 220-, 440-, 880-yard and one-mile freestyle, the 100-yard backstroke and 440-yard breaststroke, and a 4x50-yard freestyle relay.

By the 20th century, swimming had become mainstream. Indoor pools were beginning to appear, most towns with populations over 20,000 had public outdoor pools, and swimming clubs became increasingly popular for recreation. Women participated for the first time in swimming in the Olympic Games in Stockholm in 1912, and Johnny Weissmuller (considered by many authorities to be the greatest swimmer of all time and who later went on to Tarzan fame in movies) became the first person to swim 100 meters in less than one minute.

Today swimming is the second most popular exercise activity in the United States, with approximately 360 million annual visits to recreational water venues. Swim clubs, recreation centers, Ys, and many other facilities feature swimming pools. Many high schools and colleges have competitive swim teams, and of course, swimming is one of the most popular Olympic sports. Millions of Americans are swimming each year. Are you one of them? If not, the following information may help get you started.

This Super Bowl showcased everything there is to love—and hate—about the NFL. As Sunday’s gripping, chaotic, and dizzying Super Bowl wound to a close, NBC analyst Cris Collinsworth inadvertently revealed something critical about understanding the NFL. With the New England Patriots facing a third-and-long with less than 12 minutes left in the game and trailing the Seattle Seahawks by 10 points, Collinsworth described a conversation he had with Tom Brady about the ball deflation controversy that had roiled the league for two straight weeks.

“I said, ‘Tom, look me in the eye and tell me you couldn’t have possibly said anything to a ball boy, an assistant coach, somebody in the organization that would lead them to believe that you wanted air let out of that football,’ ” Collinsworth recounted, “and he said ‘absolutely not.’ ” His tone was of a man who had peered into the soul of the Patriots quarterback and found pure snow.

Seconds after he finished this thought, Collinsworth moaned “Owhhh!” with an apparent mix of euphoria and awe as Seahawks safety Kam Chancellor dropped Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman with a brutal and unmistakable helmet-to-helmet smack. Edelman, who missed the final two games of the regular season due to a concussion but competed in every playoff game and was one of the team’s most important players, rose to his feet and wobbled forward to try to gain extra yardage, before finally crumpling to the ground in a heap. After he struggled to get up, Collinsworth glowed at the “great play by Edelman” after the “hard hit” by a player who, teammates proudly declare, “damages people’s souls.” After such a violent play, the NFL’s concussion protocol says that a head-injury spotter in the booth is supposed to call down to the sidelines and tell the team doctors to check the player for a concussion during an eight-to-12-minute-long assessment. Detroit Free Press beat reporter Dave Birkett reported that the very first part of this process appeared to take place.

But then a funny thing happened. Edelman stayed in the game. On yet another third-and-long on the same drive, Edelman made another critical first-down reception. Again, he struggled to lift his head before ultimately picking himself up off of the ground with the help of a teammate, who grabbed him in a stabilizing hug. Collinsworth’s booth partner Al Michaels mentioned a previous Edelman hip injury to explain his apparent droopiness, but did not talk about his recent concussive history or the blow to the head he had suffered minutes earlier. These facts would be ignored for the rest of the Super Bowl broadcast. Edelman remained in the game—perhaps after undergoing a shorter than usual concussion protocol—and, after Brady threw a touchdown pass to Danny Amendola to cut the deficit to three points, he would go on to score the go-ahead touchdown one drive later.

Edelman finished the game with nine receptions, 109 yards, and that game-winning touchdown, and the Patriots went on to their fourth Super Bowl title in perhaps the most dramatic and bizarre finish the sport has ever seen. But back to Edelman and Collinsworth. What the NBC broadcaster unintentionally showed with his paeans to Brady’s moral rectitude and Edelman’s “toughness” was just how absurd the sport has become, even as it has reached the pinnacle of cultural dominance. In a post-game interview, Edelman declined to tell a reporter whether or not he had been checked for a concussion. At one point, he reportedly referred to the team the Patriots had just beaten as “St. Louis” before correcting himself. 

In the context of the ugliest season in the league’s history—one where two of the league’s biggest stars were charged respectively with domestic violence and child abuse, and the league horribly botched the investigation into one of those crimes—the weekslong obsession with whether or not the Patriots violated the rulebook by allegedly playing with intentionally underinflated balls was a demonstration of collective insanity. Even the president was asked about his thoughts on whether the Patriots were a bunch of cheating cheaters in a pregame interview, while the issue of domestic violence—in a game featuring two Seahawks defensive starters with previous domestic violence charges and Edelman, who was once arrested for assaulting a woman at a Halloween party—and the issue of concussions were not raised. (The charges against Edelman were later dropped based on the provability of the case.*)

To focus on Deflategate as yet another study of former players finding signs of cognitive damage linked to playing football was released last week is like worrying about the guy who’s stealing fake $20 bills from the bank in Monopoly while another player is swallowing handfuls of little plastic mansions. The game of football is just that, a game, and worrying over an apparent violation of its byzantine rulebook while human beings literally bash their brains in is, by any definition, silly.

And yet, I am a football fan. And I watched that football game. And, as far as games go, nothing could have been more dramatic, transfixing, and powerful as those final 12 minutes. First, there was the simultaneous improbability and inevitability of Brady leading the Patriots to the largest fourth-quarter comeback in the history of the Super Bowl. Then, after the Patriots left just enough time on the clock, there was the Seahawks’ lightning-quick drive down the field for what looked like it would certainly be a game-winning touchdown.

That drive started with one of the game’s great running backs, Marshawn Lynch, rumbling down the sideline for a beautiful 31-yard reception to put the Seahawks into Patriots territory with just under two minutes to play. At that point, a sense that this team was unstoppable, like the feeling of inevitability that occurred in their equally dramatic NFC Championship comeback, began to take hold. The series continued with improbable Seahawks hero Chris Matthews making a canny drive-saving play by breaking up what would have been a likely interception. Matthews, who had kept the team’s season alive two weeks earlier by recovering an onside kick in that championship game, had already sparked the team’s languishing offense with a long reception when it struggled early in the first half and scored a game-tying touchdown with two seconds left in that half. A year ago Matthews was working two jobs as a Foot Locker employee and a security guard, and now he was making plays that seemed like they might determine the outcome of the Super Bowl.

Seconds later, though, Matthews was overshadowed by an even more unlikely hero when Jermaine Kearse momentarily became the Seahawks’ David Tyree, making an unfathomable catch that left Brady shaking his head in bewilderment. He had to be thinking the same thing as everyone else who was watching: How could this happen again? The Patriots defender Malcolm Butler seemed to have made a great defensive play, but his tipped ball landed on top of Kearse without hitting the ground and bounced just close enough to his hands to allow him to complete a catch as unlikely as Tyree’s.

The virtually tackle-proof Marshawn Lynch then dragged defenders on his back for a 4-yard carry to put his team on the edge of the goal line with one minute remaining. This left three more potential opportunities for one of the most efficient rushers in the game to hammer the ball in for the game-winner from as close as possible. But on the next play, Patriots coach Bill Belichick showed a goal-line defense, even as the Seahawks lined up with three wide receivers. Seattle coach Pete Carroll saw this, and decided the team would be better off throwing. Butler, the Patriots’ unwitting stooge just moments earlier, spotted the offensive formation and the route, and slammed his body between Russell Wilson’s throw and Seahawks receiver Ricardo Lockette to claim what would be the game-clinching interception.
After the game a shocked Butler seemed more relieved that he wouldn’t be remembered for his role in Kearse’s spectacular catch than thrilled about his game-winning play. “I felt like if they would have won that game, it would have been my fault,” Butler said, explaining why he needed to make that interception.

To top it all off, Butler had actually seen and been beaten by that very same play in practice earlier in the week. Had he never seen the play before, maybe he wouldn’t make that pick and maybe the NFL’s commentators would be talking about the Seahawks’ brilliant title defense rather than excoriating Carroll for the worst play call in all of history.

That’s the point, though. The reason why the NFL is the most popular sports league in America and the Super Bowl is the most watched television program in the country year after year, is precisely because it provides this opportunity for live escapist drama unlike virtually any other sport. You just have to look at the wildly fluctuating win probability chart of Super Bowl XLIX to see how dramatically the game can, and often does, shift on single, improbable plays. If just one of these crucial plays goes a different direction, Brady’s two interceptions negate all 37 of his completions and the Patriots lose. After the game, the 15-year veteran, four-time Super Bowl champion, and three-time Super Bowl MVP expressed the exact fear that the undrafted rookie free agent Butler had said drove him on that final Seahawks drive. “When you lose the game, those are the ones that just sit with you for the rest of your freaking life,” Brady said. “That’s what I was thinking about when I threw those picks.”

This knife’s edge is what we love and what makes football, for all its myriad flaws, a sport that is hopefully worth saving.
