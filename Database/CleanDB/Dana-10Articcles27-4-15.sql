We ve all heard the old saying “you are what you eat.” And it s still true. If you stick to a healthy diet full of vitamins and minerals, your body reflects it. You feel healthy, energized, and just all-around great. However, people who limit their diet to junk foods will undoubtedly suffer the consequences of not giving their bodies what they need to thrive. The result is not only fatigue and low energy, but poor health as well. Understanding this clear connection between your health and your diet may spur you to make better dietary choices.

Your Diet and Your Health: What Your Body Needs
"Food is essential. People take it for granted, but we need nutrients," says Anne Wolf, RD, a researcher at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. Wolf cites as one example the old days when sailors crossed the ocean for months without proper nutrition. As a result, they ended up with scurvy because of a lack of vitamin C from citrus fruits. Vitamin C and other vitamins and minerals are necessary to keep all the different parts of the body healthy and functioning — otherwise, we get sick.

Every little thing that you do happens because of the nutrients that you give your body. Says Wolf, "Food gives us the fuel to think and the energy to move our muscles. The micronutrients, the vitamins, the minerals are there so that our bodies can function. You need food not just to sustain health, but to feel better."

And the only way the body will get the many nutrients needed to stay healthy and function is by eating a wide variety of healthy foods.

Your Diet and Your Health: The Guidelines
The U.S. Department of Agricultures food pyramid and the daily food recommendations were established after extensive research and continue to be updated as more is learned about the role of nutrition in good health. Their goal is to make sure that people understand all the different nutrients their bodies need to stay healthy.


Food went from being a necessity to simply function to being the key to enabling the body to be at its functional best, says Wolf. Research shows that the right nutrition optimizes health and that getting enough of certain vitamins and minerals can also lower disease risk.

Your Diet and Your Health: Poor Diet, Poor Health
Many foods have a huge impact on heart health. Research has long shown that fruits and vegetables and a diet rich in whole grains and low in saturated fats can help protect the body from heart disease and high blood pressure, while a diet high in saturated and trans fats without enough fruits and vegetables can actually cause those diseases.

Even small diet deficiencies can have an enormously negative impact on your health. The most common health problem due to a lack of nutrients in the United States is iron deficiency, says Wolf. Menstruating women and girls need plenty of iron in their diets to replace what they lose each month during their periods. Iron is also an essential nutrient for infants, children, and growing teens.

Another example is calcium, needed to keep bones strong and healthy, says Wolf. Without it, the body can develop osteoporosis, a health condition characterized by weak and brittle bones.

Eating a well-rounded and varied diet will go a long way toward making sure you have all the nutrients you need. Remember that our body uses everything we put into it, and what we give it determines how its used — for good health, or for bad.

For my parents, who immigrated from Hong Kong in the 1970s, leaving Chinatown was how you knew you had made it in America. They worked there for 20 years in the garment industry — so that I would never have to, they insisted — but every night they made their proud exit to the New Jersey suburbs. Meanwhile, at school, I was hiding my stinky lunches from my American friends and hoping they wouldnt hear our alien language.

But when I finished college, I wanted to know the neighborhood where my parents worked, to be as Chinese as Chinatown could make me. Fifteen years later, Im still trying to figure out what Chinatown means for Chinese people. Last month, I took just a short walk for lunch but saw, on the streets and in the food, so many ways you can be from somewhere youre not really from.

Near the Bowery end On the walk back to the subway, I went under the Manhattan Bridge on Division. There, in storefront employment agencies, men just-­arrived in
 this country go to find jobs serving $4.95 General Tsos. Most of these agencies are nothing more than a desk, a counter, a map on the wall; the new immigrants learn words like “Nebraska” and “Newport News” before stepping onto a bus outside and making those words their homes. I saw a man walk into one, leathery skinned, looking slightly lost, a small slip of paper in his hand. And I wondered: Where will he want his kids to work one day? Where will he want them to go, or stay away from, to know that he has made it?of Division Street, I passed a spot that used to be the New South Wind restaurant. For 30 years, it served tea from a water heater the size of a plane engine. Lunch could have been rice with canned ham and soy sauce, or dumplings — theirs were big, clunky things with thick, bland skins. I once heard a customer disparage them as “Americanized,” but a friend, born and raised nearby, told me that her grandfather ate there because it reminded him of how the food tasted in his first days in America, when the bachelors of Chinatown made whatever they could with their rudimentary kitchen skills and strange American ingredients.

Crossing the Bowery to the living movie set of Doyers Street, I realized that you can still have a little taste of that historical fantasy (with better cooking) at Nom Wah, the oldest dim sum parlor in New York, sanguinely situated on a block constantly bloodied by gang murders when it opened in 1920. Preserved by a young new owner, it still draws crowds, many non-­­Chinese, hungry for authentic egg rolls. (My parents had never heard of egg rolls until they came here.)

Im normally tempted to drop in for one, but I was headed a block away, where a gaggle of young Chinese packed the entryway at Cha Chan Tang. In Hong Kong, eating baked food and creamy sauces was once the privilege of the wealthy, so luncheonettes called cha chaan tengs brought a little of that b?chamel class to the masses. This food, called “soy-­sauce Western,” included things like baked pork chops on ketchup-­­sweet spaghetti with the distinct taste of the woks fire and oil. It would probably seem awful to you, but for me it occupies the same exact pleasure center as boxed mac and cheese — and for older generations, it tastes a little like success. Its adaptive and aspirational. Every time someone asks me for the most “authentic” food in Chinatown, I secretly want them to eat this stuff.

As I ate condensed-­milk toast (as good as it sounds) and drank milk tea the texture of cream, I marveled at the d?cor. Simulated windows open onto an HDTV Hong Kong street scene; stare long enough, and you feel as if you can hop the bus to Kowloon. But it was after stepping back out onto Mott Street that I understood the significance of this place. Naming the restaurant Cha Chan Tang is like naming a coffee shop Coffee Shop; there used to be cha chaan tengs all over Chinatown, but this is something more. Its a Cantonese theme park, not a place to remind you of home as much as a place to remind you of where your parents used to call home. Everything has the familiarity of things you remember from vacation, but when I ordered, practicing the Cantonese in my head to make sure I had the sounds right, my server caught me off guard with totally unaccented English. He was born here, raised here. This is a new generation of Chinatown, one that doesnt mind staying.

Discover the real difference between organic foods and their traditionally grown counterparts when it comes to nutrition, safety and price.

By Mayo Clinic Staff
Once found only in health food stores, organic food is now a regular feature at most supermarkets. And thats created a bit of a dilemma in the produce aisle.

On one hand, you have a conventionally grown apple. On the other, you have one thats organic. Both apples are firm, shiny and red. Both provide vitamins and fiber, and both are free of fat, sodium and cholesterol. Which should you choose? Get the facts before you shop.

Conventional vs. organic farming

The word "organic" refers to the way farmers grow and process agricultural products, such as fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy products and meat. Organic farming practices are designed to encourage soil and water conservation and reduce pollution.

Farmers who grow organic produce dont use conventional methods to fertilize and control weeds. Examples of organic farming practices include using natural fertilizers to feed soil and plants, and using crop rotation or mulch to manage weeds.

Organic or not? Check the label

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has established an organic certification program that requires all organic foods to meet strict government standards. These standards regulate how such foods are grown, handled and processed.

Any product labeled as organic must be USDA certified. Only producers who sell less than $5,000 a year in organic foods are exempt from this certification; however, theyre still required to follow the USDAs standards for organic foods.

If a food bears a USDA Organic label, it means its produced and processed according to the USDA standards. The seal is voluntary, but many organic producers use it.

Products that are completely organic — such as fruits, vegetables, eggs or other single-ingredient foods — are labeled 100 percent organic and can carry the USDA seal.

Foods that have more than one ingredient, such as breakfast cereal, can use the USDA organic seal plus the following wording, depending on the number of organic ingredients:

100 percent organic. To use this phrase, products must be either completely organic or made of all organic ingredients.
Organic. Products must be at least 95 percent organic to use this term.
Products that contain at least 70 percent organic ingredients may say "made with organic ingredients" on the label, but may not use the seal. Foods containing less than 70 percent organic ingredients cant use the seal or the word "organic" on their product labels. They can include the organic items in their ingredient list, however.

Do organic and natural mean the same thing?

No, "natural" and "organic" are not interchangeable terms. You may see "natural" and other terms such as "all natural," "free-range" or "hormone-free" on food labels. These descriptions must be truthful, but dont confuse them with the term "organic." Only foods that are grown and processed according to USDA organic standards can be labeled organic.

The vegetable scraps you might normally toss in the garbage can make for a delicious meal when dressed up with the right…dressing.

Chef April Bloomfield calls it a “bin salad” (bin being the British term for trash can — Bloomfield hails from Birmingham, England). The author of the vegetable-forward A Girl and Her Greens, which is Yahoo Food s current Cookbook of the Week, urged the audience at her talk at New York City’s 92nd Street Y Wednesday to save beet greens, chard stems, the end bits of fennel and lettuce, and the leaves around heads of cauliflower. “The first thing you usually do is you cut the leaves off,” she said. “Leave them on! It’s really nice to be able to respect what you cook and just use things when you can if it makes sense.”

The same goes for broccoli stalks. “People throw them in the garbage, but that’s an extra portion. That’s money you can save.”

At his wastED pop-up restaurant, Blue Hill chef Dan Barber aimed to combat food waste by showing diners how tasty kale ribs, fish skin, and carrot tops can be. He served a salad made of “a selection of vegetable scraps, stalks, and outer leaves salvaged from the waste stream of a large-scale food processor,” as the wastED menu stated; Gothamist reported that those bits were served with “pistachios, damaged storage apples and pears, and whipped chickpea water, which uses the liquid drained from a can of garbanzos.”

While we cant all turn bean-y water into luscious foam, we can follow chef Melia Mardens lead. At her Manhattan restaurant The Smile, she serves a broccoli leaf salad with a simple Caesar dressing. Broccoli comes with huge, cabbage-like leaves that can be sliced, dressed, and eaten raw. 

So heres how to make a salad from items you might normally throw away: Keep those ribbons of carrot skin, those broccoli stalks, those chard stems, or those hearty leaves. Cut them small enough so that theyre easy to chew — shaved for the carrots, a 1-inch dice for the broccoli stalks and chard stems, and bite-size pieces for the kale — and dress them in something with a lot of lemon juice or vinegar to help soften them. We like to do a one-to-one mixture of lemon juice and olive oil with a bit of Dijon mustard, minced shallots, and salt and pepper. (One-to-one is a radical ratio, but thats how we like it! Feel free to adjust if its too acidic for you.) Toss them together and youre finished! Feel free to add any end bits of cooked sausage, hard-boiled eggs, the almost-past-their-peaks knobs of cheese, or whatever else needs cleaning from the fridge. And let us know how it goes.

Though most of us have experienced that lazy feeling after eating a large meal, researchers from California say their new study indicates that consistently eating processed foods and being overweight makes people tired and inactive, contrary to some beliefs maintaining laziness leads to obesity.

The researchers, from the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA), will publish their results in the journal Physiology and Behavior.

They conducted their study in rats, whose physiological systems are very similar to those of humans. Placing them in two groups, the team then fed the 32 female rats one of two diets for a period of 6 months.

The first group ate a normal rat is diet of unprocessed foods - such as ground corn and fish meal - whereas the second group was fed a lower-quality, processed diet with much more sugar. This diet served as a proxy for a junk food diet, the team says.

Observing changes over 3 months, the team noticed the rats on the junk food diet became obese, whereas the group that ate a normal, unprocessed diet did not.

These results are hardly surprising, but when the researchers gave the rats a task of pressing a lever in order to receive a reward of food or water, they found that rats on the junk food diet took much longer breaks than the lean rats. In a 30-minute session, the obese rats took breaks nearly twice as long as the lean ones.

Lead researcher Aaron Blaisdell says their findings suggest that lethargy may arise from consuming a junk food diet.

Interestingly, the investigators switched the two groups diets after 6 months. This time, the obese rats were fed the more nutritious diet for 9 days, while the lean rats were fed the processed junk food diet.

Despite eating the more nutritious diet, the obese rats weight did not improve, nor did their responses to the lever task. Additionally, when the lean rats ate junk food for 9 days, their weight did not noticeably increase, and their responses to the lever task did not become impaired.

This result suggests that a long-term pattern of eating junk food - not short-term changes - is to blame for obesity and cognitive impairments, the researchers say.

These findings highlight not just the health implications of obesity, but also social perceptions that may be incorrectly ascribed to it, as Blaisdell says:

"Overweight people often get stigmatized as lazy and lacking discipline. We interpret our results as suggesting that the idea commonly portrayed in the media that people become fat because they are lazy is wrong. Our data suggest that diet-induced obesity is a cause, rather than an effect, of laziness."

He adds that either "the highly processed diet causes fatigue or the diet causes obesity, which causes fatigue."

Poor diet linked to chronic diseases
Because the study was performed in rats - which have similar physiological systems to humans - the team believes their findings will apply to humans.

Another finding from the study shows that the rats on the junk food diet had a large number of tumors in their bodies by the end of the study, whereas those on the nutritious diet had fewer, smaller tumors.

Obesity has become a public health epidemic in the US over the last decades, where prevalence has increased to over 35% in adults and 17% in children.

Carrying with it myriad health implications, obesity has been linked to heart disease, stroke and certain cancers.

"We are living in an environment with sedentary lifestyles, poor-quality diet and highly processed foods that is very different from the one we are adapted to through human evolution," Blaisdell says. "It is that difference that leads to many of the chronic diseases that we see today, such as obesity and diabetes."

In other nutrition news, Medical News Today recently reported on a study that suggested consuming one serving of legumes each day can keep "bad cholesterol" at bay.

Do you use grits, cornmeal or polenta; cook them in stock, milk or water; and add garlic, onion or chilli? Can grits ever be too cheesy – and are they best with bacon for breakfast or shrimp for supper?
In Britain, grits are those annoying scratchy things that fly at your windscreen in the depths of winter. In the American South, they are breakfast. And not just any old breakfast either: this sloppy corn porridge is a source of fierce regional pride. As the official prepared food of the state of Georgia, grits have become a byword for Southern identity.

The Charleston Post and Courier has even suggested grits are the key to world peace, declaring that given enough grits, “the inhabitants of planet Earth would have nothing to fight about. A man full of [grits] is a man of peace.” Peacemakers or not, they are making inroads in the UK on the back of the mania for all things Americana: the Lockhart in London does a quite superlative version with shrimp, and they have popped up on the menu at Red s True Barbecue in Manchester, Squid & Whale in Glasgow, Stovells in Surrey and Norse in Harrogate. But the best way to appreciate this humble Southern classic is at home, preferably with a pitcher of sweet tea and a soundtrack of the blues.Tracking down the raw materials for grits is surprisingly tricky in Britain. It is easy enough to find polenta and cornmeal in larger supermarkets but, according to Brad McDonald, the Mississippi-born chef at the Lockhart, all corn is not made alike. He is very firm on the issue: “Polenta is not a substitute for hominy grits. I would never suggest that you make that substitution. Never. Cornmeal is also a completely different product altogether. If you are writing about perfection, you cant suggest any substitutes; you have to begin with the real thing.”

McDonald directs me towards Anson Mills of South Carolina, purveyors of goods from “organic heirloom grains” – the creme de la creme of corn dealers. They explain that traditional grits are made from softer varieties known as “dent” corn, which taste different to the harder “flint” corn used for polenta (“more corn flavour upfront … with supporting floral and mineral notes”). Also, for historical reasons, the two products are milled in a different way, which means they behave differently in the pot.
Unfortunately, although Anson Mills does ship its fine products across the ocean, the minimum order quantity is 10lb (4.5kg), and my freezer is not quite large enough to absorb the excess. However, after much poking around in the back end of Google, a US candy importer in Aldershot saves my bacon. I order stoneground grits, old-fashioned grits and quick grits – the first two coarse, the last rather finer. The more expensive stoneground variety boasts a distinctive speckled appearance that is proof it has been made from the whole kernel, rather than having its hull and germ removed to extend its shelf life. This, connoisseurs believe, is what gives stoneground grits their particular flavour and texture, as well as improving their nutritional value.

The difference is striking: the stoneground grits, both the yellow kind I buy online and the blue variety kindly gifted to me by Dan Doherty, chef at Duck and Waffle and closet grits enthusiast, taste distinctly of corn. The other two are great vehicles for other flavours, but overwhelmingly bland on their own. I cant, however, detect any significant difference in flavour between the various colours. Soaking the stoneground variety, as Edna Lewis and Scott Peacock suggest in their book The Gift of Southern Cooking, is important to allow the skimming off of any remaining chaff, which will make the end product as gritty as the name suggests.

Purists, McDonald tells me, say that you should only cook grits in water with a little salt. Like Lewis and Peacock, he goes for a 50/50 mixture of water and milk; the notorious Paula Deen cooks them in “half and half” (the closest UK equivalent is single cream with a dash of milk) and butter; Kentucky chef Amber Huffman uses chicken stock; and chef Sarah Mastracco goes for equal parts chicken stock and milk. The Joy of Cooking and Virginia Willis, a self-proclaimed grits missionary and the author of an entire book on the subject, prefer water alone.

I find the stock, though delicious, overpowers the flavour of the corn, while the cream makes things distinctly sickly. Milk and water is very nice, but to my surprise I prefer the cleaner taste of those made with water alone, rather than the sweetness of dairy.

Whichever road you go down, however, the most important thing is ensuring you allow enough liquid for the grits to cook. Mastracco goes for a ratio of one part grits to two parts liquid, which simply isnt enough, and I end up with a lengthy washing-up job on my hands. Four to one, as espoused by most other recipes, is about right.

The other important thing to bear in mind with grits is, as with polenta or porridge, low and slow is the way to go. McDonald tells me: “The idea here is to apply only enough heat to let them steep in the liquid and properly fluff up.” With stoneground grits, this means up to an hour of patient cooking, but the results are well worth the effort: smooth and creamy, rather than gluey and gritty.

McDonald advises me to stir them constantly to prevent them sticking, which is a very real danger. I find that if I use a heavy-based cast-iron pan, as he suggests, set on a very low heat, I can afford to step away from the pot occasionally, during the first half of cooking at least. (Mastracco suggests covering the pan and leaving it largely to its own devices, which, believe me, is a terrible idea.)

The Joy of Cooking and Deen supply recipes for grits that are simmered then baked. This gives them a completely different consistency to the slightly sloppy, creamy texture Im aiming for, but they make an excellent side dish.
Lewis, often touted as the standard-bearer for Southern cuisine, is of the opinion that “people should really leave grits alone”, and I have some sympathy with that – the onion used by the Joy of Cooking and the garlic in Huffmans recipe completely overpowers the flavour of the corn. Butter and salt are the only musts, as far as the traditionalist is concerned – even a spot of double cream, which Peacock favours to finish the dish, is an unnecessary dilution of the flavour.

However, the greatness of cheese grits cannot be denied. I try Deens monterey jack and Mastraccos parmesan, but neither measures up to the flavour punch of a good cheddar. Deen, who is not what you might call a calorie-counter, claims: “Sometimes I will accidentally trip when Im walking across the kitchen with a block of cream cheese, and it falls in there … You just have to go with it and say, ‘Oops!” Reading this, I instantly resolve to install non-slip flooring by my hob – her grits are so rich and claggy and cheesy, they make me feel a little sick, even without the addition of the extra grated cheese at the end (“because you can never get enough of a good thing”).

The Joy of Cooking stirs in cayenne pepper, and McDonald adds a “solid dash” of Tabasco, on the basis that “the vinegar in it opens your palate and allows more flavour in”. The chilli heat of both proves an excellent partner for cheese and toasted corn, as anyone who has ever enjoyed a plate of nachos will know all too well. It also means that, although grits are a solid choice for a weekend brunch, especially with a rasher of bacon and a fried egg, they also make a very fine accompaniment to a more substantial meal, whether that is the classic shrimp and grits or something of your own devising. (I happen to think they go very well with sprouting broccoli, but then I do write for the Guardian.)

The perfect cheese grits
185g stoneground grits
1l water
1 tsp salt flakes
2 tbsp butter
50g mature cheddar, grated
½ tsp cayenne pepper or smoked paprika, or good dash of Tabasco or other hot sauce

Put the grits in a large bowl, cover with cold water and stir. Leave to sit for a minute or so, then skim as much of the floating chaff from the surface as you can, and drain.

Bring the water to a simmer in a large, heavy-based pan (a cast-iron one is ideal). Dissolve the salt in it, then stir in the grits. Turn down the heat very low, and cook, stirring very regularly, until the grits start to thicken – they should be steaming rather than bubbling.

Stir continuously until the grits have thickened to your desired consistency – a fairly sloppy porridge is usual, which will probably take about 45 minutes. Take off the heat and stir in the butter, cheese and cayenne, paprika or Tabasco to taste.

Grits: one of those things you have to grow up with to truly appreciate, or polenta s humbler but hotter cousin? If you are a fan, how do you like them – plain in the morning or poshed up at night? And are there any British-grown grits lurking out there?

Our culinary power duo – restaurateur Dimbleby and chef Baxter – return with this new column that celebrates cooking for groups and gatherings without fuss. To kick off: a mean chicken gratin with seasonal green trimmings ...
Over the past year, we have attempted to unpick some of the basic principles of cooking to help novice and nervous cooks get started in the kitchen. Nows the time to put that new?found confidence to the test.
Over the coming weeks, well be trying to help you cook for a wider audience. There is nothing that gives me more pleasure than cooking for friends and family. In an increasingly digital world, there is something so visceral (literally) about people taking something you have prepared with love and putting it inside their body. Its almost indecently intimate.


Our 10 best spring recipes

This may be partly why nervous cooks dread the thought of preparing a feast for others – in case they get it wrong. Much of this anxiety is caused by the problem of timing, so we will endeavour to put together menus that dont require everything to be done at the last minute. We have also created our Kitchen CountdownTM (below) to help you see at a glance what needs to be done when.

We are starting you off gently, with a simple lunch that just happens to involve a few distinct stages. This gratin would traditionally be made as a way to use up a spent laying hen. Poaching softens the dense fibres of an older bird, and the eggs that were still inside the bird s body – a little production line of golden orbs of increasing sizes – would be used to thicken the sauce. But unless you live on a farm, laying hens are pretty hard to get hold of – so we have used flour as the thickener instead.

This is a perfect dish for a warm spring evening, served with new season asparagus and greens. So invite some friends, head out into the garden and open the year s first bottle of ros?.

Chicken, leek and prosciutto gratin
Serves 6
For the chicken and stock
1.5kg whole chicken
500ml chicken stock (if you cannot get hold of fresh chicken stock then it is OK to use water instead)
1 onion, sliced
1 leek, chopped
1 carrot, peeled and roughly chopped
8 peppercorns
1 bay leaf

For the sauce
40g butter
40g flour
500ml chicken stock
1 tsp English mustard
1 tbsp chopped tarragon
Salt and black pepper

For the gratin
80-100g prosciutto, roughly shredded
1 leek cut in half lengthways and sliced across into 1cm pieces
100g soft breadcrumbs
0.5 garlic clove, chopped
1 tbsp chopped parsley
1 tbsp finely grated parmesan
1 tsp olive oil
Salt and black pepper

1 To make the stock: place the whole chicken in a deep saucepan into which it fits snugly, breast-side up, along with the stock vegetables. Pour in the stock until it almost covers the chicken. Bring the pan to a simmer and cover with a lid. Cook gently for about 1 hour. Turn the chicken upside?down in the stock and cook for around 10 minutes longer. Turn off the heat, then allow the chicken to cool in the stock.

2 Prepare the meat: remove the chicken from the saucepan and pull off all the meat from the carcass, tearing any large pieces into strips about 1-2cm wide. Put the shredded meat into the fridge. Return the chicken bones to the stock and bring it back up to a simmer. Leave it for another hour, uncovered, then strain and set aside.

3 To make the sauce: bring the chicken stock to a gentle simmer in one pan while heating the butter over a medium heat in another. The pan with the butter needs to be big enough to fit all of the stock comfortably. When the butter has completely melted, tip in the flour and stir well with a wooden spoon until you have a paste. Stir over a low heat for at least 3 minutes – it should go a golden colour but should not brown. Now start adding the stock a ladle at a time. If you have never made a velout? or white sauce before the first few ladles can be quite alarming as the flour will clump up and you will be convinced the sauce is going to be lumpy. But stir it well between each ladle and you will end up with something silky smooth. When all the stock has been added, whisk the sauce and simmer for 5 minutes to ensure the flour has cooked through. Add the mustard and tarragon, then season well.

4 To assemble the gratin: set the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Arrange the cooked chicken, prosciutto and leeks in an ovenproof dish. Pour over the sauce. Mix all the rest of the ingredients in a bowl. Season and sprinkle over the chicken and sauce. Cook for about 30 minutes until the top is golden brown. (If you made the sauce the day before and it is fridge-cold, you may need to add 10 minutes.)

5 While the chicken gratin is cooking, prepare your veg.

Spring greens with garlic and parmesan
1 tbsp butter
1 tbsp olive oil
1 garlic clove, crushed and peeled
2 large bunches spring greens, washed and thinly sliced
1 tbsp grated parmesan
Salt and black pepper

1 Melt the butter and oil in a large pan. Add the garlic and cook for a minute without colouring. Tip in the greens and stir well over a medium heat for 5 minutes until they are wilted. Stir in the parmesan and season well.

Grilled asparagus
2 bunches of asparagus

You might think that you can get away with eating fatty foods for a few days without it making any significant changes to your body.

Think again.

After just five days of eating a high-fat diet, the way in which the body s muscle processes nutrients changes, which could lead to long-term problems such as weight gain, obesity, and other health issues, a new study has found.

"Most people think they can indulge in high-fat foods for a few days and get away with it," said Matt Hulver, an associate professor of human nutrition, foods, and exercise in the Virginia Tech College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. "But all it takes is five days for your body s muscle to start to protest."

In an article published recently in the online version of the journal Obesity, Hulver and other Virginia Tech researchers found that the manner in which muscle metabolizes nutrients is changed in just five days of high-fat feeding. This is the first study to prove that the change happens so quickly.

"This shows that our bodies are can respond dramatically to changes in diet in a shorter time frame than we have previously thought," said Hulver, who is the head of the department and a Fralin Life Science Institute affiliate. "If you think about it, five days is a very short time. There are plenty of times when we all eat fatty foods for a few days, be it the holidays, vacations, or other celebrations. But this research shows that those high-fat diets can change a person s normal metabolism in a very short timeframe."

When food is eaten, the level of glucose in the blood rises. The body s muscle is a major clearinghouse for this glucose. It may break it down for energy, or it can store it for later use. Since muscle makes up about 30 percent of our body weight and it is such an important site for glucose metabolism, if normal metabolism is altered, it can have dire consequences on the rest of the body and can lead to health issues.

Hulver and his colleagues found that muscles  ability to oxidize glucose after a meal is disrupted after five days of eating a high-fat diet, which could lead to the body s inability to respond to insulin, a risk factor for the development of diabetes and other diseases.

To conduct the study, healthy college-age students were fed a fat-laden diet that included sausage biscuits, macaroni and cheese, and food loaded with butter to increase the percentage of their daily fat intake. A normal diet is made up of about 30 percent fat and students in this study had diets that were about 55 percent fat. Their overall caloric intake remained the same as it was prior to the high fat diet. Muscle samples were then collected to see how it metabolized glucose. Although the study showed the manner in which the muscle metabolized glucose was altered, the students did not gain weight or have any signs of insulin resistance.

Hulver and the team are now interested in examining how these short-term changes in the muscle can adversely affect the body in the long run and how quickly these deleterious changes in the muscle can be reversed once someone returns to a low-fat diet.

Olive oil, fish, honey, milk, and fruit juices are common, everyday foods found in most people s kitchens. However, these common foods may not contain the food ingredients you think.

The honey in your pantry may contain antibiotics, chemicals and added sweeteners. The salmon in your refrigerator may not even be salmon, but instead may be a lesser-quality fish. The 100-percent Italian extra virgin olive oil in your pantry may contain vegetable or canola oil and may not even be from Italy. The fruit juices in your refrigerator may contain juices from rotten fruit and toxic mold.
Fish, honey, olive oil, milk, select spices (saffron, black pepper, chili powder), fruit juices, meat, grains and organic foods are among the top food products at risks for food fraud.

What is Food Fraud?

There is no statutory definition of food fraud, and different countries, researchers and industry groups have defined it in various ways. However, food fraud is most commonly referred to as the intentional defrauding of food and food ingredients for economic gain. Food fraud is estimated to cost the global food industry $10-$15 billion a year.

Food fraud can occur in a variety of situations. Food or food ingredients may be substituted for lower-quality, inferior ingredients, or one species for another. Food ingredients may be diluted with water, or main ingredients may be omitted or removed.

Some producers deceive consumers, manufactures, retailers, and governments for the sole purpose of making money. Many consumers are not interested in how the food they consume is produced or where it comes from but are more concerned about being able to purchase food inexpensively. The lack of interest and knowledge by the consumer increases the risk of food fraud by producers and manufacturers who are solely interested in making a big profit.

Although the majority of food fraud cases have not resulted in death or serious illnesses, food fraud can still be a food safety concern. Food products can be substituted with a common allergen, such as tree nuts or eggs, and can cause severe adverse reactions to consumers.

Unfortunately, food fraud is not a new concept and has been going on for thousands of years. In the Middle Ages, when the price of imported spices increased, merchants would substitute spices with seeds, stones or dusts. In the 18th and 19th centuries, milk was commonly diluted with water, sometimes dirty water, and colored with chalk or plaster.

Over the past couple of years, there have been several reported food fraud incidents. In 2013, consumers in England, France, Greece and several other countries were duped and unknowingly purchased meatballs, burgers and other food products that contained horse meat. The suppliers of the products were aware that their products contained horse meat, but instead of declaring it on the product labels, the suppliers saw an opportunity to make money and deceive their consumers who thought they were buying beef.

Several food fraud incidents have also originated in China. In 2007, a food fraud incident in China resulted in the death of a large number of dogs and cats in the U.S. after they ate pet food containing lower-cost melamine instead of the required protein. Honey manufactured in China was also discovered to contain antibiotics. After discovering antibiotics in honey manufactured in China, the U.S. imposed a tariff. However, the defrauding of consumers did not stop there. To get around paying the tariff, Chinese manufacturers started routing their honey to other countries, including India and Argentina, so the label on the honey would read “from Argentina” or “from India.” Fake eggs, contaminated baby formula, tofu fermented with sewer water, and gutter oil resold as vegetable oil are some other reported cases of food fraud in China.

Food fraud incidents that occur in other countries severely impact U.S. consumers. In the past decade, the food industry has become completely globalized. Huge amounts of food products, ranging from fresh produce to fish, are imported to the U.S. In 2012, the U.S. imported 4.1 billion pounds of food products from China alone.

Over the past few years, many consumers have become more conscious about what they consume and are purchasing more local and organic foods. However, even consumers who buy organic foods and foods from local farmers markets are at risk of being defrauded. Numerous “farmers” purchase produce from wholesale suppliers and resell the produce as home-grown and organic. Some produce, marketed as organic or pesticide-free, can be laden with pesticides.

What is Being Done to Regulate Food Fraud?

Last year, California passed a new law aimed at combating food fraud after discovering numerous cases of food fraud at farmers markets around the state. Some of the most notable provisions of the new law include increasing the farmers market vendor s fee, in order to hire more state inspectors to investigate food fraud, and requiring vendors to display the name and location of the farm and the statement, “We grow what we sell.” If a vendor violates this statement, they can be fined up to $2,500 and imprisoned for up to six months.

This law is a good example of ways that states and even local farmers markets can get together and create laws or rules to protect one of the few places consumers can get food that comes directly from producers. The closer consumers are to the producers of their food, the harder it is for producers to defraud consumers.

In addition to state laws and farmers markets rules, food fraud is broadly regulated by various federal agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Department of Justice, the National Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration, and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.

FDA and USDA are the primary agencies equipped with the statutory authority to regulate and prevent food fraud.

FDA is responsible for ensuring the safety of most of the U.S. food supply except for most meat and poultry products. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) contains several provisions that FDA can use to regulate and prevent food fraud and enforce related laws. Under the FFDCA, adulterated and misbranded foods are prohibited from being sold and delivered to consumers. There are a variety of statutorily prescribed reasons a food can be adulterated or misbranded. A food can be adulterated if it contains a poisonous substance injurious to human health, is missing valuable ingredients, or if there is a substitution or addition of ingredients. A food can be misbranded if it contains a false or misleading label, is sold under a different name, or is an imitation of another food. An example of a food product that is prohibited because it is adulterated and misbranded would be olive oil labeled as 100-percent extra virgin but instead contains used vegetable and peanut oil.

Other provisions under the FFDCA can also be used to regulate and prevent food fraud. The FFDCA gives FDA the authority to monitor and inspect food imported for sale in the U.S. by requiring all foreign food manufacturing facilities that want to sell in the U.S. to register with FDA (with some exceptions) and give advance notice of imported shipments of food. The new food safety law, the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), also contains numerous provisions that can be applied to food fraud. FDA also has authority to refuse entry of food imported to the U.S. if it appears to be misbranded or adulterated.

USDA is responsible for the safety of meat, poultry and some egg products in the nation s food supply. The Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA), the Poultry Products Inspection Act (PPIA), and the Egg Products Inspection Act grant USDA the authority to continually inspect meat, poultry and egg products intended for human consumption. This includes the inspection and evaluation of foreign meat and poultry plants that intend to sell meat and poultry products in the U.S. Similar to FDA, USDA can also regulate food fraud through prohibition of adulterated or misbranded meat, poultry and egg products, and various import standards.

Producers that violate the various provisions that apply to food fraud can be subjected to criminal penalties, civil penalties and/or product seizures.

Although USDA and FDA have mechanisms to identify, enforce and prevent food fraud, all cases of food fraud cannot be detected. FDA does not have the resources or personnel to physically inspect the majority of imported foods and enforce the regulations. For example, in 2011, FDA only physically inspected 2.3 percent of all food and feed imports. Additionally, even though USDA inspects meat and poultry processing plants, its impossible for the inspectors to check every single carcass that gets processed into meat.

What is Being Done to Track and Decrease Food Fraud?

It is hard to determine how widespread food fraud is in the U.S. because those who commit food fraud want to avoid detection.

However, two databases have been created that can help track food fraud incidents. The U.S. Pharmacopeial Convention (USP) Food Fraud Database is a searchable database composed of both scientific and mainstream media reports on food fraud incidences. The USP database is organized by the report type, food ingredient category, food ingredient, adulterant, type of fraud and the publishing year. The second database is the National Center for Food Protection and Defense (NCFPD) EMA Incident Database. This database contains documented incidences of food fraud that have occurred since 1980. Access to this database is available upon request. This database provides information about the food product, adulterant, the type of adulterant, health consequences, and how the incident was discovered. (Go here for more information about food fraud from NCFPD.)

These databases can help decrease food fraud by informing consumers, manufacturers, retailers, and governments of the most common food products at risk of food fraud and types of adulterants. Retailers and manufacturers can use this information to implement stricter standards for producers of high-risk foods and food ingredients. The government can use this information to create new laws or policies to combat food fraud in the identified high-risk food products.

On March 15, 2015, the U.S. government took a huge step toward decreasing the amount of food fraud occurring in the seafood industry. The Obama administration announced it was planning on implementing a system that will track the origins of every wild fish and crustacean shipped into the U.S. This system will be phased in over a two-year period.

This system is a step in the right direction toward combating food fraud. However, there is still a huge disconnect between food producers and consumers that has enabled rapid occurrences of food fraud. The best way for consumers to avoid food fraud is to connect to their local producers. Consumers should take the time to get to know local producers and visit the farms where their food is purported to be grown. Food fraud incidents will continue to occur until consumers start reconnecting to the land and the producers of our nation s food supply.
