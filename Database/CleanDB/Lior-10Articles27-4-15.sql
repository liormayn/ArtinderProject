\n\n  When Jared Leto chopped off his perfectly ombré-ed locks, it was a double whammy of heartbreak: The loss of both a crush and amazing hair inspo in one. Though it was for a worthy cause (Letos role as The Joker in Suicide Squad), the actors Instagram feed seems to indicate that he misses his flowy locks just as much as we do.

In fact, hes going through a bit of an existential crisis:


Because nothing brings joy like a full head of shiny hair:

\n\n  Last night, in a moving (and path-paving) interview with 20/20s Diane Sawyer, Bruce Jenner, the Kardashian clans patriarch, revealed what several media outlets have been speculating since early last year: Hes transitioning and will soon be living exclusively as the female hes known he was since age eight. "For all intents and purposes," he told Sawyer, "I am a woman."

"My whole life," he said, "has been preparing for this moment."

The 1976 decathlon gold medalist who forged a lucrative career as a motivational speaker in the 80s before becoming the muted father figure on E!s hit reality series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, confessed to sneaking into his sisters closet to try on one of her dresses as a kid. "I put a scarf over my short hair" he recalled, and walked around outside. "I didnt know why I was doing it," he said, noting that there were no trans cultural guideposts at the time to help him understand the discontinuity he felt between his body and gender, "It just made me feel good."

While he was able to channel his inner turmoil and self-discomfort into a spectacular athletic career—and distract himself with three marriages and ten children over the years—his gender demanded self expression, even if only in the privacy of his own home, but with a family as big as his, the house was rarely entirely empty. He told Sawyer about two incidents during which Kim Kardashian, his stepdaughter, and Kendall, his daughter with ex-wife, Kris, caught him in womens clothes.

"Kim walked out, jumped in the car went for a drive," and didnt bring it up again until reports of his transition hit the presses years later. Kendall discovered his secret via digital footage: She thought her younger sister Kylie was stealing her clothes so she put her computer on security mode and it captured her dads every move as soon as he walked in to check out his outfit in their full-length mirror.

Toward the end of the interview, there was a sweet exchange between Jenner and Sawyer. He invited her into his closet to show her the elegantly sexy black dress hed later wear at their off-camera one-on-one dinner together. His eyes sparkled as he shared it with her.

These sartorial moments and memories, along with a few other things, struck me when watching the special. First, I should say that I think its invaluably important that Jenner brought his story to the national stage—his sacrifice for the greater good of the trans community cannot be underestimated. But since it wasnt addressed in ABCs two hour program, I think its worth remembering that there is not only one way to be trans. There are several degrees and varying formulations of tranness, some of which dont call for sex confirmation surgery or even hormone therapy. Some like to stay in an ambiguous limbo between sexes.

This point, which is relevant as a reminder that there isnt one blueprint for trans actualization, leads me to an odd self-discovery recently. While Ive always identified as lesbian, Ive had the recent realization that my gender doesnt sync up with my body as squarely as Ive tried to think. As someone who regularly watches Female to Male video diaries to marvel at the muscle-building power of testosterone shots with the unfulfilled hope of gaining as much mass sans shots, and as someone who has never looked at a female body for workout inspiration but rather pulls up Brad Pitt or a young Marlon Brando in a Google image search for motivation, Im not entirely sure that I dont straddle some unmarked line between standard fair dyke and quasi transman. There is so much overlap, which is why I felt so acutely Jenners painful, awkward, and exhilarating memories of secretly trying on womens garb.

His anecdotes remind me how vital clothing is to self-understanding and expression. What to wear is not a trivial or small decision—every day its an active creative form of self assertion. I think its a significant part of gender presentation that bears contemplation and elaboration. As a fledgling dyke growing up in the 80s, my gender didnt at all align with my mothers feminine preferences for my wardrobe. Shed often confine me to dresses, which was so out of whack with my self conception, Id weep in protest, while coveting (and sometimes stealing) my brothers clothes. It was agonizing. It was cruel. She didnt know any better, and perhaps now she will.

Whether or not you consider the Kardashian tribe to be vapid, perhaps symptomatic of cultural decline as some highbrows contend, their entire (superficial) enterprise may have been worth it for what Jenner called this "one real, true story."

"Jenners transition as such a public icon is a cultural milestone," transman Shannon Minter, who heads the legal division of the National Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco, CA, tells ELLE.com. "Jenners story has the potential to greatly increase public understanding and support."

Trans rights activist and director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, Mara Keisling agreed: "Stories like Jenners help change the narrative about who transgender people are. Millions of Americans now have a bridge to understanding the truth behind the struggles of being transgender in 2015 America."

Perhaps the most eloquent words and sentiments came from multi-hypenate "genius" Kanye West when he explained why his wife Kim must offer Jenner her full support and love. According to Jenner, Kanye told Kim: "Look, I can be married to the most beautiful woman in the world, and I am. I can have the most beautiful little daughter in the world, and I have that. But Im nothing if I cant be me. If I cant be true to myself, they dont mean anything."

Kim took those words to heart and in turn offered Jenner her first bit of woman-to-woman advice: "Girl, you gotta rock it, baby!"

Were not really sure when the transition from drink-all-the-vodka-sodas-you-can-muster to we-should-probably-just-order-a-bottle happens, but it does. And when it does, unless youre like Hallie from The Parent Trap who grew up around vintages and varietals, youre left kind of fumbling around, swirling whatever you ordered at the restaurant in the glass and smelling it in an attempt to seem like you know what the hell youre doing. Even worse? The wine store, where all wino knowledge goes out the window in favor of a bright bottle with some cool calligraphy on its label. (That means its fancy, right?)

BUT NO MORE. You are an adult, goddammit, and you should A) at least have a working knowledge of varietals, AKA the type of grape used for the wine, lest you become one of those poor fools who, thanks to Waka Flocka Flame, goes into a bar to order Moscato only to realize its a sweet wine, and B) talk about something you imbibe on the regular with some kind of authority.

We caught up with Michael Turley, manager and wine director of NYCs Irvington restaurant, for the easiest-to-remember tips on choosing a great wine. (Cause we know youre not going to write this down.)


WE RECOMMEND
Why Prunes Gabrielle Hamilton Makes It a Point to Hire Women
*READ* THE LABEL
I know, I know. We just said were not going to look at the label, but were not talking about looking for a cute font. Read, young grasshopper. While wines that say "table wine" or "California wine" might be perfectly delicious, they also raise red flags. "These wines are composed of grapes from a very large region (a state or even an entire country) and, although sometimes just fine in quality, tend to be noticeably bland or unbalanced," says Turley.

RECOGNIZE WHY SOMETHINGS ON SALE
While your local wine store might just have crazy deals all the time, most stores put wine on sale for two reasons, according to Turley. 1) The ideal consumption window for the vintage has come and gone, or 2) the wine just isnt selling and the store wants to clear out inventory. Neither of these things necessarily equal a bad wine, but its something to look out for before stocking up on that Pinot Noir just because its marked down 10 bucks.

KNOW YOUR ADJECTIVES
This is a big distinction—especially for those who say they hate "sweet wines." "There is a difference between a sweet wine and one that is fruit-forward," notes Turley. "Sweet wines, like a port or some Rieslings, tend to be more syrupy, which is wines way of exhibiting sweetness. But a wine may have a nose of tropical fruit and honeysuckle but, upon tasting, are crisp, clean and wash out the mouth in a quick flush." So stop with the vague terms, friends. (And know which one to ask for.)

CHOOSE EASY PAIRINGS
Pairings—this is when things get interesting. As Turley notes, there are two schools of thoughts when it comes to wine and food pairings: complementary and contrasting. Neither is wrong. (So if someone tries to argue with your Twinkies and Gewürztraminer, remind them that it they are both sweet and pull a Jan from Grease: "It says right here, it is a dessert wine.") If going the complementary route, just remember light with light and rich with rich. Meaning seafoods and chicken pair amazingly with crisp white wines and red meats and cheeses pair well with full-bodied reds. As for a great contrasting pairing? "Classic oysters with a New World Sauvignon Blanc, such as a great option from New Zealand," says Turley. "The salty brine of the oysters is balanced by the fruit-forward expression of this grape. Think of it like peanut butter and jelly."

WHEN IN DOUBT? GO FOR A ROSÉ
I know youre probably saying "whaaaaat?" but its true. "A crisp, dry rosé will have refreshing acidity and lively effervescence to help accent most dishes," says Turley. "Rosés also work especially well with cheese plates." Turley recommends a *sparkling* rosé. (Ooh la la.)

IF ALL ELSE FAILS, DOWNLOAD AN APP
"I am a committed fan of the Wine Spectator app, which has a comprehensive database of wine ratings organized by price points and varietals," says Turley. "Comparing ratings with prices can help make the decision a no-brainer."

1) Indabas 2014 Western Cape Chenin Blanc; $7 "Round and lush, with a great, long finish."

2) Layer Cakes 2013 Central Coast Chardonnay; $16 "Classic varietal expression with ripe apple and honeydew melon flavors."

3) Bodegas Ramón Bilbaos 2011 Garnacha Rioja; $20 "Rich berries, chocolate, and spices PLUS great structure and style? This a go-to big red."

The Hamptons that Joey Wölffer, 33, knew growing up was far removed from the Bacchanalian carnival the area can be today. Wölffer spent her time show-jumping horses and exploring the bucolic 175 acres of her familys Wölffer Estate Vineyard and Stables, coming home to find guests like Bianca Jagger stopping by in riding clothes for lunch.

Currently a co-owner of the winery and equestrian center, she divides her time between Sag Harbor and Manhattan with her husband, Max Rohn, the winerys general manager. Her other projects include The Styleliner, a mobile boutique run out of a refurbished potato delivery truck (its stationed at the winery for the summer); a line of handbags; and a baby— shes due in July. Calling from Paris, where she was stocking up on Styleliner goods, she shares a few of the local spots that retain the bohemian flavor she remembers from her youth.

BASK:
Wölffer is partial to oceanside picnics, particularly on mellow Sagaponacks Gibson Beach, which tends to be less crowded than nearby stretches of sand. For supplies, she stops at Serene Green, a farm stand that sells everything from locally grown berries to seafood, along with specialty goods like fresh mozzarella from Red Horse Market in East Hampton.


WOLFFER.COM
EAT:
Wölffer heads to Sen in Sag Harbor for sushi and "good vibes." Another favorite is the atmospheric Italian spot Tutto il Giorno in Southampton (entrees from $33), where diners can opt to sit outside on a tree-lined terrace. Afterward, Wölffer recommends dessert at BuddhaBerry, a frozen-yogurt shop with a toppings bar featuring not just candy but superfoods like chia seeds and hemp hearts. "This summer, youll find me with my belly and my BuddhaBerry in the pool," she says.

SHOP:
Collettes locations in Sag Harbor and Southampton offer consignment clothes culled from the predictable bounty of glamorous local closets. (An opalescent sequined sweatshirt Wölffer bought there a few years ago remains a dependable mood- changer.) Wölffer also loves Matta in Sag Harbor, where jewelry starts at about $45 and the hippie-chic selection includes handmade sarongs and scarves. For home decor, Black Swan Antiques has an eclectic mix that ranges from midcentury-modern lamps and ornate Victorian woodwork to perfectly worn Americana.

COLETTE
STAY:
Wölffers go-to is The Maidstone in East Hampton, where the Scandinavian- inflected decor tends toward brightly hued rugs and playful wallpaper. An added bonus: The hotel will prepare guests a picnic lunch they can take to the beach.

When I reach model Kat Hessen by Skype earlier this week, she is at home in Los Angeles, chowing down on a plate of takeout taquitos. You’ll forgive her appetite—the Norwegian-native and Alexander Wang and Chanel runway regular skipped her hour lunch break at her EMT class to speed over to a Louis Vuitton casting on her motorcycle. Modeling may be the last thing on her mind today as she discusses bike trips and big adventures, but—much like when she and her fiancé had to postpone the rest of their motorcycle tour of Guatemala so that she could walk exclusively for Chloé for fall 2015—the fashion world has a tendency to come up.


The willowy, apple-cheeked eccentric adheres to an On the Road–style freewheeling type of life fantasized about by 9-5ers chained to their desks: Hessen is everywhere and anywhere she wants to be, whether that’s cruising up to Canada on a motorcycle to escape a hurricane or joining a relative stranger on a road trip to Florida after her second-ever Fashion Week. “I met this guy,” Hessen says of the man who became her fiancé, “and it was the middle of Fashion Week and he was like, ‘Do you want to come on my motorcycle out to Florida?’ It was February and March, so we both had hypothermia and we were disgusting. We just stayed in motels or with people we met, but it was really fun.” A few years later, they embarked on a trip from London to Africa after they spotted an inexpensive dirt bike on Craigslist. “We thought we could ride all the way to Morocco,” she says. “But we ended up going all the way to Nigeria before the bike exploded.”  They ended up stranded in Mauritania, hitching rides from locals, camping out with a family, and heading briefly to Senegal, before Hessen and her fiancé contracted malaria and staph infections and were deported for lack of proper visas, eventually returning stateside.

They recovered quickly and moved to the West Coast, bouncing around makeshift living spaces ranging from a rented aircraft hangar to an ambulance purchased on Craigslist. “We didn’t have a kitchen,” says Hessen. “And we didn’t have any money so we just ate canned tuna and rice. At the end I weighed about 95 pounds.” Hessen enrolled in classes at a community college and an EMT course at UCLA. “When we were sick [in Africa], I kind of felt helpless and I also felt like an idiot. I feel like basic skills are going to become a lot more important. We would meet people and they’d be like, ‘So, what do you guys do?’ We work in fashion. . . .” says Hessen, who recalled a conversation with the matriarch of the Mauritanian family she had met on the road: “[The man we stayed with] was nice to his wife but she still didn’t have any power over her own life. She said to me, ‘The only blessing I have in life is that I don’t have any daughters. At least my sons can be something, they can be masters of their own fate, but as a woman here you have nothing, you don’t make a single decision for yourself.’” You could say Hessen’s newfound interest in medicine is rooted in her determination to be the master of her own destiny. “If I’m going through the jungle on a motorcycle with my fiancé and he gets hurt and I don’t know how to save him, that would be a tragedy,” the model says, “because that is preventable.”

That same electrifying obsession with independence is evident in her diamond-in-the-rough Instagram account @delikathessen; a sarcastic, comical array of social observations ranging from a woman using a selfie stick on a ledge that reads “Keep Off” and images of dolls that poke fun at the modeling industry to Hessen’s failures at freight train–jumping in Las Vegas. The one thing you won’t find on the social media outlet? A casting, test, or runway shot. “I think women, in general, we kind of just tell them that as long as you look pretty and upload loads of sexy pictures up on Instagram, the greatest cause of feminism is making sure that you can show your nipples on the Internet. Like, OK, that’s great, but do you know about women who can’t get an education or women who get circumcised when they are two years old? I don’t give a shit about your nipples: Spend your energy on something else. If that is your biggest problem, that you don’t feel liberated as a woman, then you are overprivileged, and you have too much time on your hands I think.” Plus, Hessen’s instagram is personal, she says, “That is the only part [of my life] that is public that I actually get to be myself, and it would be a shame to waste it by posting modeling pictures.” We have the feeling that she’ll be getting a lot more opportunities to be herself soon enough.

1. Take Siri to School
Tired of Siri pronouncing things wrong? Next time she screws something up, tell her, "Thats not how you pronounce X," and then pronounce it for her. Shell give it another try and offer you a few options for how she now thinks shes supposed to pronounce the word. Pick the one that sounds the best, and Siri will use that pronunciation from now on.

2. Level Up
Need a level for a quick DIY project at home? The compass app on your iPhone has one built in. To use it, open up the compass app on your phone, and then swipe to the left to pull up the level screen.

3. Give Better Vibrations
Youre not limited to the same vibration for everything. Go into the Settings of your phone and then select Sounds, Vibration, and then Create New Vibration to tap out your own buzzing pattern. You can name your creation and then use it as a vibration alert for anything youd like. For instance, you could have one vibration pattern to signal that youve received a text and another for tweets or emails. Once youve implemented your own secret code, you wont need to pull your phone out of your pocket nearly as much.

4. Control Your Camera With Your Headphones
Arms not quite long enough to get the whole family into that selfie? Use your earbuds as a remote shutter button for your iPhones camera. Simply launch the camera as normal, set up your shot, and then press the volume-up button to snap a photo.

5. Block Calls From Your Ex
Tired of constant calls from your ex or a persistent telemarketer? Block calls from a specific number by clicking the "i" button beside their most recent call or pulling up their contact card in your phone, and selecting Block This Caller from the bottom of the page. Once blocked, you will no longer see texts or calls from that person. If you make up later on, you can unblock their number by going to Settings, Phone, and then Blocked, and removing them from your list.

6. Put a Sleep Timer on Your Jams
Like to listen to tunes while youre going to sleep? You can use the timer on your iPhone to schedule when your music will stop so that it cuts out soon after you fall asleep. Go to the clock feature on your phone and select Timer. Choose how long youd like music to play as the length of the timer, and then select When Timer Ends from the page. Next, scroll to the bottom of the list of available alarm sounds and then select Stop Playing from the options. Finally, hit Start on the timer. Now your tunes will stop playing when the time hits zero.

7. Power Up Faster
Have only a few minutes to charge your phone before heading out on the town? Put it in airplane mode to make it power up twice as fast. Since your phone wont have to use any juice to search for and connect to a wireless tower or a Wi-Fi network, it can concentrate on getting charged up. (Airplane mode is also a great way to stretch that last 5 percent of battery life.)

8. Show the Time Stamp of Every Text
Struggling to remember exactly when you sent that last text (and if its too soon to send another one)? Slide a single text to the left to reveal the time stamp on all of the texts on the page.

9. Go Undercover
Dont want anyone to see when your significant other suddenly decides to send you a saucy text? You can disable the home screen preview for messages so that any nosy screen-lookers see only "iMessage" rather than details about your scandalous after-dinner plans. Disable preview by going to Settings, Notification Center, and then Messages. In the Messages page, toggle the Show Preview button to the off position. While youre poking around, you might also want to toggle off the Send Read Receipts feature. Turning it off means that people who send you iMessages will only be able to tell a message has been delivered, not whether or not youve read it. You can get to it by going back to your main Settings page and selecting Messages.

10. Remind Yourself to Buy Toilet Paper
The iPhone will allow you to create a geofence around a particular location, and send you a reminder whenever you pass through its virtual gates. For instance, a fence around your local grocery store can remind you to pick up some TP while you shop, or a fence at the office can be the nudge you need to remember to pass along that project file you keep forgetting. Set up a geofence by going into your phones Reminders app, create a reminder, and then tap the "i" beside it. Select "Remind me at a location" from the next page, and then add the address where youd like to receive a notification and whether youd like to get it as youre arriving at the place or as youre about to leave.

Sense of smell is one of the closest senses tied to memory. Just one sniff of your grandmas perfume or dads shirt, and all the memories of earlier days come flooding back. But what happens when those closest to you pass away and you can no longer seek out the scent of your loved ones for comfort?

Katia Apalategui, a 52-year-old French insurance saleswoman, conjured up a new way to cope after mourning the loss of her father: A perfume scented just like him. According to The Guardian, the process, which extracts the persons odor from a piece of clothing, doesnt just rely on his or her signature perfume scent but instead collects the smell of the loved ones skin, hair, and body for a truly unique fragrance.

Apalategui plans to launch the perfume company in September that will offer grieving families at funeral homes to opportunity to create their own sentimental fragrance for $600. Although the focus right now is on bottling the scent of the deceased, shes hoping to extend the service to those who want to capture the scent of their living loved ones in the future.

Every morning I follow the same routine: wake up, drink coffee, eat breakfast, shower, have a complete meltdown about what Im going to wear to work that day. Despite the fact that they happen every morning, the wardrobe crises come as a fun little paralyzing and torturous surprise every day. Why? Because somehow, even though my closet is full, I have NOTHING TO WEAR. Here, the 24 things that go through my brain when I get dressed in the morning:

1. OK, Im going to plan my outfit for today in the shower so itll be the fastest getting-ready day ever.

2. I should wear something like what Miranda Kerr wore — that camel skirt with perfect white button-down.

3. I wish I owned a camel-colored leather skirt. Or a perfect white button-down.

4. Whatever, Ill figure it out when Im actually out of the shower and in front of my closet. Visualizing is hard.

5. Crapppp. This is all crap. Crappppp. I dont own any clothes.

6. No clothes, no clothes, like, actually zero clothes. I should really just throw all this out.

7. OK, Ill just wear jeans and some sort of sweater.

8. Wait. Why do these jeans feel like theyve just been washed? I havent done laundry in three weeks so they cannot possibly have been washed. But. Cant. Button. SO MANY SEAMLESS REGRETS.

9. Ill wear a skirt. Will people remember I wore this skirt yesterday? Crapcrapcrap.

10. OK, Ill just do these effing tight jeans and a biggish sweater to hide the muffin top.

11. Wait, why do I look so big in this big sweater? Nope, nope, nope.

12. Hmm, is this shirt too wrinkled? How dark is the office?

13. I mean, do I even interact with people during the day? Its probably fine?

14. Do I look like a boy?

15. Maybe if I curl my hair a bit, Ill look better. Just, like, some effortless Gisele waves to pull it all together. Even though Ive never used this curling iron thing before, this seems like a good idea to try right now.

16. Oh god, this doesnt look like Gisele. Straightnerrrr.

17. Maybe a cat-eye will look fancy and distract people?

18. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Its OK, Ill just wash my face. Should I shower again?

19. Jeeeeessussss, how has it been 45 minutes. OK, just decide what to wear and it will be whatever and that is fine.

20. Dont look in the mirror.

21. Murderrrrrrrrrer. I cant wear this! Have my hips ALWAYS LOOKED LIKE THIS?
