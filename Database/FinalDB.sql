Were not really sure when the transition from drink-all-the-vodka-sodas-you-can-muster to we-should-probably-just-order-a-bottle happens, but it does. And when it does, unless youre like Hallie from The Parent Trap who grew up around vintages and varietals, youre left kind of fumbling around, swirling whatever you ordered at the restaurant in the glass and smelling it in an attempt to seem like you know what the hell youre doing. Even worse? The wine store, where all wino knowledge goes out the window in favor of a bright bottle with some cool calligraphy on its label. (That means its fancy, right?)

BUT NO MORE. You are an adult, goddammit, and you should A) at least have a working knowledge of varietals, AKA the type of grape used for the wine, lest you become one of those poor fools who, thanks to Waka Flocka Flame, goes into a bar to order Moscato only to realize its a sweet wine, and B) talk about something you imbibe on the regular with some kind of authority.

We caught up with Michael Turley, manager and wine director of NYCs Irvington restaurant, for the easiest-to-remember tips on choosing a great wine. (Cause we know youre not going to write this down.)

*READ* THE LABEL
I know, I know. We just said were not going to look at the label, but were not talking about looking for a cute font. Read, young grasshopper. While wines that say "table wine" or "California wine" might be perfectly delicious, they also raise red flags. "These wines are composed of grapes from a very large region (a state or even an entire country) and, although sometimes just fine in quality, tend to be noticeably bland or unbalanced," says Turley.

RECOGNIZE WHY SOMETHINGS ON SALE
While your local wine store might just have crazy deals all the time, most stores put wine on sale for two reasons, according to Turley. 1) The ideal consumption window for the vintage has come and gone, or 2) the wine just isnt selling and the store wants to clear out inventory. Neither of these things necessarily equal a bad wine, but its something to look out for before stocking up on that Pinot Noir just because its marked down 10 bucks.

KNOW YOUR ADJECTIVES
This is a big distinction—especially for those who say they hate "sweet wines." "There is a difference between a sweet wine and one that is fruit-forward," notes Turley. "Sweet wines, like a port or some Rieslings, tend to be more syrupy, which is wines way of exhibiting sweetness. But a wine may have a nose of tropical fruit and honeysuckle but, upon tasting, are crisp, clean and wash out the mouth in a quick flush." So stop with the vague terms, friends. (And know which one to ask for.)

CHOOSE EASY PAIRINGS
Pairings—this is when things get interesting. As Turley notes, there are two schools of thoughts when it comes to wine and food pairings: complementary and contrasting. Neither is wrong. (So if someone tries to argue with your Twinkies and Gewürztraminer, remind them that it they are both sweet and pull a Jan from Grease: "It says right here, it is a dessert wine.") If going the complementary route, just remember light with light and rich with rich. Meaning seafoods and chicken pair amazingly with crisp white wines and red meats and cheeses pair well with full-bodied reds. As for a great contrasting pairing? "Classic oysters with a New World Sauvignon Blanc, such as a great option from New Zealand," says Turley. "The salty brine of the oysters is balanced by the fruit-forward expression of this grape. Think of it like peanut butter and jelly."

WHEN IN DOUBT? GO FOR A ROSÉ
I know youre probably saying "whaaaaat?" but its true. "A crisp, dry rosé will have refreshing acidity and lively effervescence to help accent most dishes," says Turley. "Rosés also work especially well with cheese plates." Turley recommends a *sparkling* rosé. (Ooh la la.)

IF ALL ELSE FAILS, DOWNLOAD AN APP
"I am a committed fan of the Wine Spectator app, which has a comprehensive database of wine ratings organized by price points and varietals," says Turley. "Comparing ratings with prices can help make the decision a no-brainer."

STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOURE DOING? HERE ARE TURLEYS TOP 5 PICKS (YOURE WELCOME)

1) Indabas 2014 Western Cape Chenin Blanc; $7 "Round and lush, with a great, long finish."

2) Layer Cakes 2013 Central Coast Chardonnay; $16 "Classic varietal expression with ripe apple and honeydew melon flavors."

3) Bodegas Ramón Bilbaos 2011 Garnacha Rioja; $20 "Rich berries, chocolate, and spices PLUS great structure and style? This a go-to big red."

4) Charles & Charles 2013 Columbia Valley Post No.35 Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah; $11.99 "Lush berry and plum notes are guided through by easy tannins and a confident finish."

5) Ameztoi Rubentis 2014 Txakolina Rosé; $21 "Full of strawberry and watermelon juiciness, while remaining dry and fresh on the palate. A perfect springtime-in-the-park or summertime-by-the-beach wine."

  Last night, in a moving (and path-paving) interview with 20/20s Diane Sawyer, Bruce Jenner, the Kardashian clans patriarch, revealed what several media outlets have been speculating since early last year: Hes transitioning and will soon be living exclusively as the female hes known he was since age eight. "For all intents and purposes," he told Sawyer, "I am a woman."

"My whole life," he said, "has been preparing for this moment."

The 1976 decathlon gold medalist who forged a lucrative career as a motivational speaker in the 80s before becoming the muted father figure on E!s hit reality series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, confessed to sneaking into his sisters closet to try on one of her dresses as a kid. "I put a scarf over my short hair" he recalled, and walked around outside. "I didnt know why I was doing it," he said, noting that there were no trans cultural guideposts at the time to help him understand the discontinuity he felt between his body and gender, "It just made me feel good."

While he was able to channel his inner turmoil and self-discomfort into a spectacular athletic career—and distract himself with three marriages and ten children over the years—his gender demanded self expression, even if only in the privacy of his own home, but with a family as big as his, the house was rarely entirely empty. He told Sawyer about two incidents during which Kim Kardashian, his stepdaughter, and Kendall, his daughter with ex-wife, Kris, caught him in womens clothes.

"Kim walked out, jumped in the car went for a drive," and didnt bring it up again until reports of his transition hit the presses years later. Kendall discovered his secret via digital footage: She thought her younger sister Kylie was stealing her clothes so she put her computer on security mode and it captured her dads every move as soon as he walked in to check out his outfit in their full-length mirror.

Toward the end of the interview, there was a sweet exchange between Jenner and Sawyer. He invited her into his closet to show her the elegantly sexy black dress hed later wear at their off-camera one-on-one dinner together. His eyes sparkled as he shared it with her.

These sartorial moments and memories, along with a few other things, struck me when watching the special. First, I should say that I think its invaluably important that Jenner brought his story to the national stage—his sacrifice for the greater good of the trans community cannot be underestimated. But since it wasnt addressed in ABCs two hour program, I think its worth remembering that there is not only one way to be trans. There are several degrees and varying formulations of tranness, some of which dont call for sex confirmation surgery or even hormone therapy. Some like to stay in an ambiguous limbo between sexes.

This point, which is relevant as a reminder that there isnt one blueprint for trans actualization, leads me to an odd self-discovery recently. While Ive always identified as lesbian, Ive had the recent realization that my gender doesnt sync up with my body as squarely as Ive tried to think. As someone who regularly watches Female to Male video diaries to marvel at the muscle-building power of testosterone shots with the unfulfilled hope of gaining as much mass sans shots, and as someone who has never looked at a female body for workout inspiration but rather pulls up Brad Pitt or a young Marlon Brando in a Google image search for motivation, Im not entirely sure that I dont straddle some unmarked line between standard fair dyke and quasi transman. There is so much overlap, which is why I felt so acutely Jenners painful, awkward, and exhilarating memories of secretly trying on womens garb.

His anecdotes remind me how vital clothing is to self-understanding and expression. What to wear is not a trivial or small decision—every day its an active creative form of self assertion. I think its a significant part of gender presentation that bears contemplation and elaboration. As a fledgling dyke growing up in the 80s, my gender didnt at all align with my mothers feminine preferences for my wardrobe. Shed often confine me to dresses, which was so out of whack with my self conception, Id weep in protest, while coveting (and sometimes stealing) my brothers clothes. It was agonizing. It was cruel. She didnt know any better, and perhaps now she will.

Whether or not you consider the Kardashian tribe to be vapid, perhaps symptomatic of cultural decline as some highbrows contend, their entire (superficial) enterprise may have been worth it for what Jenner called this "one real, true story."

"Jenners transition as such a public icon is a cultural milestone," transman Shannon Minter, who heads the legal division of the National Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco, CA, tells ELLE.com. "Jenners story has the potential to greatly increase public understanding and support."

Trans rights activist and director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, Mara Keisling agreed: "Stories like Jenners help change the narrative about who transgender people are. Millions of Americans now have a bridge to understanding the truth behind the struggles of being transgender in 2015 America."

Perhaps the most eloquent words and sentiments came from multi-hypenate "genius" Kanye West when he explained why his wife Kim must offer Jenner her full support and love. According to Jenner, Kanye told Kim: "Look, I can be married to the most beautiful woman in the world, and I am. I can have the most beautiful little daughter in the world, and I have that. But Im nothing if I cant be me. If I cant be true to myself, they dont mean anything."

Kim took those words to heart and in turn offered Jenner her first bit of woman-to-woman advice: "Girl, you gotta rock it, baby!"

The Hamptons that Joey Wölffer, 33, knew growing up was far removed from the Bacchanalian carnival the area can be today. Wölffer spent her time show-jumping horses and exploring the bucolic 175 acres of her familys Wölffer Estate Vineyard and Stables, coming home to find guests like Bianca Jagger stopping by in riding clothes for lunch.

Currently a co-owner of the winery and equestrian center, she divides her time between Sag Harbor and Manhattan with her husband, Max Rohn, the winerys general manager. Her other projects include The Styleliner, a mobile boutique run out of a refurbished potato delivery truck (its stationed at the winery for the summer); a line of handbags; and a baby— shes due in July. Calling from Paris, where she was stocking up on Styleliner goods, she shares a few of the local spots that retain the bohemian flavor she remembers from her youth.

BASK:
Wölffer is partial to oceanside picnics, particularly on mellow Sagaponacks Gibson Beach, which tends to be less crowded than nearby stretches of sand. For supplies, she stops at Serene Green, a farm stand that sells everything from locally grown berries to seafood, along with specialty goods like fresh mozzarella from Red Horse Market in East Hampton.


WOLFFER.COM
EAT:
Wölffer heads to Sen in Sag Harbor for sushi and "good vibes." Another favorite is the atmospheric Italian spot Tutto il Giorno in Southampton (entrees from $33), where diners can opt to sit outside on a tree-lined terrace. Afterward, Wölffer recommends dessert at BuddhaBerry, a frozen-yogurt shop with a toppings bar featuring not just candy but superfoods like chia seeds and hemp hearts. "This summer, youll find me with my belly and my BuddhaBerry in the pool," she says.

SHOP:
Collettes locations in Sag Harbor and Southampton offer consignment clothes culled from the predictable bounty of glamorous local closets. (An opalescent sequined sweatshirt Wölffer bought there a few years ago remains a dependable mood- changer.) Wölffer also loves Matta in Sag Harbor, where jewelry starts at about $45 and the hippie-chic selection includes handmade sarongs and scarves. For home decor, Black Swan Antiques has an eclectic mix that ranges from midcentury-modern lamps and ornate Victorian woodwork to perfectly worn Americana.

COLETTE
STAY:
Wölffers go-to is The Maidstone in East Hampton, where the Scandinavian- inflected decor tends toward brightly hued rugs and playful wallpaper. An added bonus: The hotel will prepare guests a picnic lunch they can take to the beach.

When I reach model Kat Hessen by Skype earlier this week, she is at home in Los Angeles, chowing down on a plate of takeout taquitos. You’ll forgive her appetite—the Norwegian-native and Alexander Wang and Chanel runway regular skipped her hour lunch break at her EMT class to speed over to a Louis Vuitton casting on her motorcycle. Modeling may be the last thing on her mind today as she discusses bike trips and big adventures, but—much like when she and her fiancé had to postpone the rest of their motorcycle tour of Guatemala so that she could walk exclusively for Chloé for fall 2015—the fashion world has a tendency to come up.


The willowy, apple-cheeked eccentric adheres to an On the Road–style freewheeling type of life fantasized about by 9-5ers chained to their desks: Hessen is everywhere and anywhere she wants to be, whether that’s cruising up to Canada on a motorcycle to escape a hurricane or joining a relative stranger on a road trip to Florida after her second-ever Fashion Week. “I met this guy,” Hessen says of the man who became her fiancé, “and it was the middle of Fashion Week and he was like, ‘Do you want to come on my motorcycle out to Florida?’ It was February and March, so we both had hypothermia and we were disgusting. We just stayed in motels or with people we met, but it was really fun.” A few years later, they embarked on a trip from London to Africa after they spotted an inexpensive dirt bike on Craigslist. “We thought we could ride all the way to Morocco,” she says. “But we ended up going all the way to Nigeria before the bike exploded.”  They ended up stranded in Mauritania, hitching rides from locals, camping out with a family, and heading briefly to Senegal, before Hessen and her fiancé contracted malaria and staph infections and were deported for lack of proper visas, eventually returning stateside.

They recovered quickly and moved to the West Coast, bouncing around makeshift living spaces ranging from a rented aircraft hangar to an ambulance purchased on Craigslist. “We didn’t have a kitchen,” says Hessen. “And we didn’t have any money so we just ate canned tuna and rice. At the end I weighed about 95 pounds.” Hessen enrolled in classes at a community college and an EMT course at UCLA. “When we were sick [in Africa], I kind of felt helpless and I also felt like an idiot. I feel like basic skills are going to become a lot more important. We would meet people and they’d be like, ‘So, what do you guys do?’ We work in fashion. . . .” says Hessen, who recalled a conversation with the matriarch of the Mauritanian family she had met on the road: “[The man we stayed with] was nice to his wife but she still didn’t have any power over her own life. She said to me, ‘The only blessing I have in life is that I don’t have any daughters. At least my sons can be something, they can be masters of their own fate, but as a woman here you have nothing, you don’t make a single decision for yourself.’” You could say Hessen’s newfound interest in medicine is rooted in her determination to be the master of her own destiny. “If I’m going through the jungle on a motorcycle with my fiancé and he gets hurt and I don’t know how to save him, that would be a tragedy,” the model says, “because that is preventable.”

That same electrifying obsession with independence is evident in her diamond-in-the-rough Instagram account @delikathessen; a sarcastic, comical array of social observations ranging from a woman using a selfie stick on a ledge that reads “Keep Off” and images of dolls that poke fun at the modeling industry to Hessen’s failures at freight train–jumping in Las Vegas. The one thing you won’t find on the social media outlet? A casting, test, or runway shot. “I think women, in general, we kind of just tell them that as long as you look pretty and upload loads of sexy pictures up on Instagram, the greatest cause of feminism is making sure that you can show your nipples on the Internet. Like, OK, that’s great, but do you know about women who can’t get an education or women who get circumcised when they are two years old? I don’t give a shit about your nipples: Spend your energy on something else. If that is your biggest problem, that you don’t feel liberated as a woman, then you are overprivileged, and you have too much time on your hands I think.” Plus, Hessen’s instagram is personal, she says, “That is the only part [of my life] that is public that I actually get to be myself, and it would be a shame to waste it by posting modeling pictures.” We have the feeling that she’ll be getting a lot more opportunities to be herself soon enough.

1. Take Siri to School
Tired of Siri pronouncing things wrong? Next time she screws something up, tell her, "Thats not how you pronounce X," and then pronounce it for her. Shell give it another try and offer you a few options for how she now thinks shes supposed to pronounce the word. Pick the one that sounds the best, and Siri will use that pronunciation from now on.

2. Level Up
Need a level for a quick DIY project at home? The compass app on your iPhone has one built in. To use it, open up the compass app on your phone, and then swipe to the left to pull up the level screen.

3. Give Better Vibrations
Youre not limited to the same vibration for everything. Go into the Settings of your phone and then select Sounds, Vibration, and then Create New Vibration to tap out your own buzzing pattern. You can name your creation and then use it as a vibration alert for anything youd like. For instance, you could have one vibration pattern to signal that youve received a text and another for tweets or emails. Once youve implemented your own secret code, you wont need to pull your phone out of your pocket nearly as much.

4. Control Your Camera With Your Headphones
Arms not quite long enough to get the whole family into that selfie? Use your earbuds as a remote shutter button for your iPhones camera. Simply launch the camera as normal, set up your shot, and then press the volume-up button to snap a photo.

5. Block Calls From Your Ex
Tired of constant calls from your ex or a persistent telemarketer? Block calls from a specific number by clicking the "i" button beside their most recent call or pulling up their contact card in your phone, and selecting Block This Caller from the bottom of the page. Once blocked, you will no longer see texts or calls from that person. If you make up later on, you can unblock their number by going to Settings, Phone, and then Blocked, and removing them from your list.

6. Put a Sleep Timer on Your Jams
Like to listen to tunes while youre going to sleep? You can use the timer on your iPhone to schedule when your music will stop so that it cuts out soon after you fall asleep. Go to the clock feature on your phone and select Timer. Choose how long youd like music to play as the length of the timer, and then select When Timer Ends from the page. Next, scroll to the bottom of the list of available alarm sounds and then select Stop Playing from the options. Finally, hit Start on the timer. Now your tunes will stop playing when the time hits zero.

7. Power Up Faster
Have only a few minutes to charge your phone before heading out on the town? Put it in airplane mode to make it power up twice as fast. Since your phone wont have to use any juice to search for and connect to a wireless tower or a Wi-Fi network, it can concentrate on getting charged up. (Airplane mode is also a great way to stretch that last 5 percent of battery life.)

8. Show the Time Stamp of Every Text
Struggling to remember exactly when you sent that last text (and if its too soon to send another one)? Slide a single text to the left to reveal the time stamp on all of the texts on the page.

9. Go Undercover
Dont want anyone to see when your significant other suddenly decides to send you a saucy text? You can disable the home screen preview for messages so that any nosy screen-lookers see only "iMessage" rather than details about your scandalous after-dinner plans. Disable preview by going to Settings, Notification Center, and then Messages. In the Messages page, toggle the Show Preview button to the off position. While youre poking around, you might also want to toggle off the Send Read Receipts feature. Turning it off means that people who send you iMessages will only be able to tell a message has been delivered, not whether or not youve read it. You can get to it by going back to your main Settings page and selecting Messages.

10. Remind Yourself to Buy Toilet Paper
The iPhone will allow you to create a geofence around a particular location, and send you a reminder whenever you pass through its virtual gates. For instance, a fence around your local grocery store can remind you to pick up some TP while you shop, or a fence at the office can be the nudge you need to remember to pass along that project file you keep forgetting. Set up a geofence by going into your phones Reminders app, create a reminder, and then tap the "i" beside it. Select "Remind me at a location" from the next page, and then add the address where youd like to receive a notification and whether youd like to get it as youre arriving at the place or as youre about to leave.

Sense of smell is one of the closest senses tied to memory. Just one sniff of your grandmas perfume or dads shirt, and all the memories of earlier days come flooding back. But what happens when those closest to you pass away and you can no longer seek out the scent of your loved ones for comfort?

Apalategui plans to launch the perfume company in September that will offer grieving families at funeral homes to opportunity to create their own sentimental fragrance for $600.

Every morning I follow the same routine: wake up, drink coffee, eat breakfast, shower, have a complete meltdown about what Im going to wear to work that day. Despite the fact that they happen every morning, the wardrobe crises come as a fun little paralyzing and torturous surprise every day. Why? Because somehow, even though my closet is full, I have NOTHING TO WEAR. Here, the 24 things that go through my brain when I get dressed in the morning:

1. OK, Im going to plan my outfit for today in the shower so itll be the fastest getting-ready day ever.

2. I should wear something like what Miranda Kerr wore — that camel skirt with perfect white button-down.

3. I wish I owned a camel-colored leather skirt. Or a perfect white button-down.

4. Whatever, Ill figure it out when Im actually out of the shower and in front of my closet. Visualizing is hard.

5. Crapppp. This is all crap. Crappppp. I dont own any clothes.

6. No clothes, no clothes, like, actually zero clothes. I should really just throw all this out.

7. OK, Ill just wear jeans and some sort of sweater.

8. Wait. Why do these jeans feel like theyve just been washed? I havent done laundry in three weeks so they cannot possibly have been washed. But. Cant. Button. SO MANY SEAMLESS REGRETS.

9. Ill wear a skirt. Will people remember I wore this skirt yesterday? Crapcrapcrap.

10. OK, Ill just do these effing tight jeans and a biggish sweater to hide the muffin top.

11. Wait, why do I look so big in this big sweater? Nope, nope, nope.

12. Hmm, is this shirt too wrinkled? How dark is the office?

13. I mean, do I even interact with people during the day? Its probably fine?

14. Do I look like a boy?

15. Maybe if I curl my hair a bit, Ill look better. Just, like, some effortless Gisele waves to pull it all together. Even though Ive never used this curling iron thing before, this seems like a good idea to try right now.

16. Oh god, this doesnt look like Gisele. Straightnerrrr.

17. Maybe a cat-eye will look fancy and distract people?

18. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Its OK, Ill just wash my face. Should I shower again?

19. Jeeeeessussss, how has it been 45 minutes. OK, just decide what to wear and it will be whatever and that is fine.

20. Dont look in the mirror.

Water and our everyday habits are inextricably connected. With 2014 being California’s fourth driest year on record, there’s a renewed focus on this precious resource. Here are some easy ways you can help conserve at home.
Load the Dishwasher
Most newer, efficient dishwashers use much less water than washing by hand; make sure it’s full to get the most out of your water.
Use It Twice
When you rinse produce, save the water to put on your plants. 
Xeriscape 
Design your landscape to reduce the need for water. Try drought-tolerant plants like cacti, and herbs that need less water, such as sage and thyme. 
Good to the Last Drop 
Use a rain barrel to collect water for your garden.
Check for Efficiency
Consider upgrading fixtures and appliances, such as toilets and washing machines, to water-efficient models.
Take It Outside
Compost instead of using the garbage disposal (you’ll save water and reduce food waste).

We lined up the usual suspects—mustard, ketchup, mayo and relish—and took a closer look at the nutrition stats of our favorite burger and dog toppings. What we found: it’s easy to rack up sodium and overrun your 2,300 mg daily limit (plus some extra calories and sugar) when you use a heavy hand with the condiments. Here’s what to know before you stock up for your summer BBQs.
Ketchup
Ketchup has about 4 grams (1 teaspoon) of sugar per tablespoon, most of which is added sugar (aim for no more than 6-9 teaspoons of added sugar per day). There’s not a lot of variation among brands, so choose your favorite. 
Mayonnaise
The top-selling condiment in America also packs the biggest calorie punch. Save on calories with low-fat mayo (a mere 15 calories per tablespoon) or light mayo, but be aware that these may have added sugars and starches. For a cleaner ingredient list, choose regular mayo (about 100 calories per tablespoon) and smear on sparingly. 
Relish
Whether you prefer sweet or dill, watch out for fake food dyes (like Yellow 5) and look for a jar with 90 mg of sodium or less per tablespoon—some have more than 300 mg!
Mustard
Brands span from 30-125 mg of sodium per teaspoon—which is a pretty big range for such a small amount. Squeeze out a tablespoon and you could be looking at 15 percent of your daily sodium limit. Look for mustard with no more than 65 mg of sodium per teaspoon (Dijon varieties tend to be the highest). 
Other tasty toppers to try: Load up on the vegetables. Put out plenty of lettuce, tomato, red onion, avocado or get fancy with grilled eggplant, mushrooms and peppers to boost the taste and nutrition of your burgers and dogs.

When I entertain, I often make Mexican food. It’s easy, budget-friendly and everyone loves it. Plus I can please vegetarians, vegans, omnivores and even kids without making myself crazy, and the leftovers are always welcome.
With Cinco de Mayo around the corner, I’m already planning my next Mexican fiesta. Lucky for me (and you!), I have the perfect Mexican menu all queued up. Fresh salsas, melt-in-your-mouth steak, creamy black beans, zesty shrimp and more recipes that seem impressive, but are actually incredibly simple, will line my table and fill my friends’ plates. Huge bonus: Almost everything can be made in advance, so you have little to do but enjoy hanging out with your guests.
This menu comes courtesy of Mexico City-born chef Roberto Santibañez. He now calls New York City home and cooks up delicious Mexican fare in his Fonda restaurants. The recipes are simple yet packed with flavor. Make the menu and we guarantee it will become your go-to entertaining menu this summer!
Here’s the menu plus make-ahead tips for all the dishes. Just warm up some tortillas and you’re good to go!
Grilled Tomatillo-Chipotle Salsa (Salsa de Tomatillo Asado con Chile Chipotle): In this salsa recipe, tomatillos are softened on the grill and slightly charred for smoky flavor. To vary the heat, use 1 teaspoon of chipotle powder for mild and up to 3 teaspoons for a little kick in the pants. 
Grilled Pineapple Salsa with Cucumber (Salsa de Piña Asada con Pepino y Habanero): Habanero chile gives this caramelized pineapple salsa recipe a little spice. If you’re looking to tame the heat, try fresh jalapeños instead. 
Make-ahead tip: The flavors of these two salsas have a chance to fully develop when you make them the day before. On fiesta day, let them stand at room temperature for about an hour to get the chill out before serving.
Chile-Marinated Skirt Steak (Carne Asada en Adobo de Guajillo): Dried chiles are toasted, soaked and pureed to make a flavorful steak marinade. Toasting the chiles in a heavy, dry skillet is the key to unlocking their flavor (not just their heat). Look for dried chiles in the produce section of many markets.
Make-ahead tip: Skirt steak is best when it has time to soak up the flavors of any seasonings. Make this toasted chile marinade up to 5 days ahead and rub it on the steak the day before the party. All that’s left to do: grill and slice.

Mexican Black Beans (Frijoles Negros con Hoja de Aguacate):  This authentic recipe for black beans uses avocado leaves to add a flavor reminiscent of anise. If you don’t have a Latin market in your area you’ll likely have to go online to get avocado leaves, though it’s worth it. But even if you leave them out, you’ll still have an awesome pot of black beans.
Make-ahead tip: A pot of black beans takes 1 to 2 hours to become tender, depending on how fresh your beans are. Make them up to 3 days ahead and then slowly reheat on the stovetop (thinning with a little broth or water as needed) about an hour before serving.

Roasted Poblano Chiles with Onion (Rajas):  This chunky Mexican side dish called rajas, which literally means “strips” in Spanish, is a perfect side to grilled steak or chicken and a fantastic taco topper.
Make-ahead tip: Do a little pre-party multitasking: while the black beans are simmering, grill and peel the poblanos for this taco topping. 

Garlic-Oregano Grilled Shrimp (Camarones Asada en Escabeche):  Escabeche, a quick pickling of already-cooked food, is a common way of preparing fish and vegetables in Mexico. In this version, the shrimp are grilled first, then infused with flavor from a chile, herb and vinegar marinade.
Make-ahead tip: You can make the marinade for these zesty shrimp a day or two ahead. Then about an hour before your guests arrive, pop the shrimp on the grill; let them marinate as the party heats up.

Honeydew Melon Agua Fresca (Agua de Melon Verde):  We’ve knocked back the sugar quite a bit in this agua fresca recipe. This refreshing drink is often a way that Mexicans use up their leftover fruit, so feel free to use this technique with whatever fruit you have, especially other melons and tropical fruits like pineapple and mango.

Make-ahead tip: Make the agua fresca one day in advance.

Listen up. I have a secret to share, one that I rarely admit. I really like hot dogs. So when I first discovered uncured hot dogs (also labeled “no nitrates or nitrites added”), I immediately bought them. 
Nitrates and nitrites are key in hot dogs and other cured meats like ham and bacon: they prevent spoilage and block the growth of the bacterium that causes botulism (a foodborne illness). They’re types of salts, with nitrates naturally found in many vegetables and converted to nitrites in your body—or in the lab. But I also knew the preservatives are believed to be associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer.
So these uncured dogs were the healthier choice, right? Turns out most uncured meats still have nitrates/nitrites in them—they just come from a natural source like celery powder. They’re labeled “uncured” and “no nitrates or nitrites added” because that’s what USDA labeling laws require when naturally sourced nitrates/nitrites are used. 
According to a 2011 study, uncured meats may contain just as many nitrates/nitrites, if not more, than conventional meats. But whether they have more or less might not matter. For cancer, it’s still unknown if the preservatives are the cause or if it’s something else in cured meats that’s harmful. Plus, newer research suggests that nitrates/nitrites may help lower blood pressure and improve exercise performance. To this end, experts suggest eating more nitrate-rich veggies, such as beets. 
The Bottom Line: Pick a hot dog that you feel good about eating—only 5 to 20 percent of the average American’s dietary nitrates/nitrites comes from cured meats. But it’s a good idea to limit them: eating lots of cured meats may up your colorectal cancer risk.

Growing up in the South, I was served biscuits at breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner. Each family and restaurant has their own specific way of making them. Some are skinny and tall, others flat and wide, and some come nestled together like Parker House rolls in cast-iron pans. Served with butter or jam, smothered with gravy or topped with ham and cheese or a piece of fried chicken, biscuits are as Southern as bourbon, collards and mac and cheese. 
Even though my mom has lived in the South for nearly 20 years, she’s never gotten quite accustomed to biscuits. She is in the scone camp. She likes the crunchy, slightly sweet baked good, especially alongside a good cup of coffee. And since she is the baker in the house, I became accustomed to and developed a love for scones too. They are still my go-to coffee-shop splurge, especially at 4 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon.
So when I was tasked with developing healthy scone recipes for the Test Kitchen section of the March/April 2015 issue of EatingWell magazine, my first thought was, “What’s the difference between a scone and a biscuit?” After doing a little digging, I discovered the answer generally boiled down to one ingredient: eggs. Scones have them, biscuits don’t.
Other than that, the ingredients and process are pretty much the same. Both scones and biscuits are usually made with some combination of flour, baking powder or baking soda (or a combination of both), salt, sugar, milk or buttermilk, eggs (if you’re making scones) and a fat (butter, Crisco, lard). The dry ingredients are mixed together, the fat is “cut in” with a pastry cutter, two knives or your fingers, and the liquid is added until the dough just comes together. The dough is gently kneaded very briefly then cut into circles or triangles and baked.
I followed the same general recipe for our healthy scones, replacing some of the all-purpose flour with whole-wheat and using just enough butter to give them great flavor. Then I mixed in sweet or savory ingredients to make each variation special. The result? The easiest, healthiest and most delicious scones you’ve ever had. Enjoy! 
Chocolate-Cherry Scones:
These chocolate and cherry scones are a perfect dessert or special breakfast treat. Feel free to swap out the cherries for other dried fruit, such as dried cranberries, figs or dates.
Morning Glory Scones:
Full of carrots, raisins, pecans and coconut, these scones are as easy to make as a batch of muffins. Pecans were our favorite nut in this recipe, but you could also use peanuts, walnuts or pistachios.
Lemon-Poppy Seed Scones:
These classic lemon and poppy seed scones are for the purist. For an extra hit of lemon and sweetness, try the Sweet Scone Glaze made with lemon juice. 
Ham & Cheese Scones:
Black Forest ham, Cheddar cheese and chives make these savory scones ideal for brunch or as a new take on a dinner roll. For a different flavor, try swapping out the Cheddar cheese for Gruyère, Asiago or Gouda. 
Smoked Salmon & Dill Scones:
Instead of layering smoked salmon, red onion and dill on a bagel, we’ve created a delicious savory scone with those ingredients mixed right in. You could also try other smoked fish, such as smoked trout.   

Sun-Dried Tomato, Thyme & Asiago Scones:
This Italian-inspired scone blends slightly sweet sun-dried tomatoes, salty Asiago cheese and savory thyme. Cut it in half and layer with Italian-style deli meats, such as prosciutto and/or pepperoni, pickled banana peppers and provolone, for an easy picnic meal.

When I was tasked with testing vegetable noodle makers—aka “spiralizers”—I was hesitant. Growing up with a Chinese father, I primarily ate an Asian-inspired diet that included a lot of rice. But on special occasions, I had another option: noodles. And like most kids, when given the choice between rice and noodles, I’d always pick noodles. Noodles, in this case, meant ramen, lo mein, soba or egg and I loved them all—and still do. I was afraid that vegetable versions of my beloved noodles couldn’t come close to my enjoyment of the starchy originals. 
Boy, was I wrong. Vegetable noodles are usually lower in calories and, depending on the vegetable, higher in fiber, vitamin C, vitamin A and a bevy of other good things. Vegetable noodles also add a layer of delicious flavor to the recipes, such as a touch of sweetness from sweet potatoes in the Sweet Potato Carbonara. 
Plus, they’re fun to make! In the Test Kitchen, I cut pounds and pounds of vegetables into long strands with several vegetable-noodle makers. The Paderno World Cuisine Tri-Blade Vegetable Noodle Slicer was my clear favorite. It easily turned turnips into spaghetti, zucchini into angel hair and made flat ribbons of pappardelle out of sweet potatoes. This model was the best at cutting continuous noodles (other models often cut the noodles too short), plus it was easy to clean.
If you want to swap vegetable noodles for regular noodles, think about the recipe before choosing your veggie. Root vegetables like sweet potatoes are a better choice if you want the noodles to hold their shape and be able to fill in for pasta, for example. If the vegetable noodles are going into a soup or if the recipe can benefit from some extra liquid, go for a softer, more delicate vegetable that exudes some water, such as zucchini or summer squash. 
If you don’t want to add another gadget to your kitchen, a vegetable peeler—either a regular or julienne peeler—makes fine vegetable noodles too. Make long strips with the peeler, working around the vegetable until you reach the seeds. 
Are you inspired to try vegetable noodles? Here are 4 recipes to get you started or experiment with your favorite recipes!
Shrimp Piccata with Zucchini Noodles
With the classic sauce of capers, white wine, lemon juice and a touch of butter, swapping zucchini vegetable noodles for the pasta slashes the calories in half compared to traditional recipes. 
Pork & Turnip Miso Ramen
Turnips stand in for egg noodles in this ramen “noodle” bowl with a miso-ginger broth. Pork is the most traditional meat, but this recipe would be delicious with chicken, tofu or shrimp too. Serve with sriracha hot sauce for an extra kick. 
Summer Squash Pad Thai If your garden is overflowing, this will be your new favorite recipe! Chock-full of zucchini, squash and peppers, this Pad Thai is a beautiful vegetable medley flavored with ginger and garlic. Traditional Pad Thai calls for fish sauce, but if you want to make this vegetarian, use reduced-sodium soy sauce instead. 
Sweet Potato Carbonara with KaleClassic carbonara recipes rarely feature vegetables, but in this healthy version, sweet potato noodles take the place of white pasta—and we added dark, leafy kale. Other root vegetables, such as butternut squash, carrots and celeriac, would also be delicious.

I don’t know about you, but I’ve been ready for flip-flop season for at least a month. I may still have a 4-foot-high snowbank at the top of my driveway, but the songbirds are my new alarm clock and all I can think about is spring. And after a long winter of hearty stews, rib-sticking chili and all things roasted, I’m craving the fresh, light, refreshing vegetables of spring. Luckily the best ones are showing up at farmers’ markets across the country: snappy peas, refreshing baby lettuce, spicy radishes and more. Here are 5 of my favorite spring veggies and amazing ways to cook them.
AsparagusAs one of the most iconic spring vegetables, few things beat the flavor of the first fresh, tender asparagus spears of the season. Asparagus is high in folic acid and is a good source of potassium, fiber and vitamins A, B6 and C. Panko-Crusted Asparagus Spears make a tasty side or cocktail nibble.

LettuceLettuce loves cooler weather and grows very quickly, so even if temps in your area have just started to rise recently, chances are you can still find some locally grown greens. A 2-cup bowlful has less than 15 calories yet is packed with nutrients, such as folate, vitamin C, fiber, potassium and the vitamin A precursor beta carotene, which in itself is a powerful antioxidant that helps neutralize free radicals that damage cells. Make Mixed Lettuce Salad with Cucumber Herb Vinaigrette or pile greens into a bowl with the fixings for your favorite salad.

PeasLike asparagus, there’s just something really special about how a fresh and snappy pea tastes. There’s a sweet flavor and tenderness that out-of-season peas just can’t match. A 1-cup serving provides one-third of your Daily Value of vitamin C and 3 grams of fiber. Lemon-Mint Snap Peas & Lima Beans is a great way to enjoy them while they’re at their peak.

TurnipsYou may not think of turnips as a spring vegetable, but they only take a month to grow from seed so smart farmers can turn out an early-season crop. If you find baby ones, they’re incomparably sweet and tender. Bonus: They’re rich in fiber and vitamin C. Spring Turnip Frittata is a delightful way to showcase them.

RadishesIf you want instant satisfaction from your garden, try growing radishes. They sprout up fast and you can start eating them in just a couple of weeks. And they weigh in at only 1 calorie apiece, so snack on them as much as you want! If you want to mellow their flavor, try them stir-fried with other vegetables. Or embrace their peppery flavor and layer them on sandwiches or toss them into a salad, like Radish, Celery & Snap Pea Salad.

We love a good Thai curry. And if you frequent Thai restaurants, you probably do too! You can put just about anything in a Thai curry, so we Test Kitchen cooks always keep curry paste on hand so we can whip up a curry with whatever we have hanging out in the fridge. 
When we decided to use Thai curry paste in the March/April 2015 issue for our Market Pick column (that’s where we do four different takes on one ingredient), we in the Test Kitchen thought it would only be prudent to try as many curry pastes as we could get our hands on. 
We tend to use red curry paste, which is the middle of the road in terms of heat. But you can also get yellow curry paste, which is milder than red, and green curry paste, which is hotter. Green and red get their color from chiles, the yellow from turmeric. 
Most large supermarkets carry at least one brand of Thai curry paste in their Asian section. Thai Kitchen is the most widely available brand and the one we primarily use in the Test Kitchen (we analyze our recipes with it). It’s also the lowest in sodium, so you may want to adjust any added salt if you use another brand. 
If you have a shellfish allergy, check the ingredient list—some curry pastes contain shrimp. We tested these recipes with multiple colors and brands, so whichever you pick will taste great.

We ended up tasting eight curry pastes made by three companies. We discovered that Thai Kitchen’s red curry paste is milder, while those made by Mae Ploy and Maesri are hotter and have coarser textures—you can see, feel and taste bits of shallot, galangal, chiles and garlic. We loved the galangal-forward flavor of the Maesri yellow curry and the fiery bite of the floral Mae Ploy green curry.
Now that you’re sold on it, what are you going to do with it? We have more than 20 recipes using Thai curry paste, but here are the ones we most recently created. All are delicious and will make an appearance on my dinner table soon!
 Green Chicken Curry:  If you’re looking for a basic Thai curry, start here. Try yellow curry paste if you’re not a fan of spicy food—it’s just as flavorful as red or green, with less heat. 
 Chicken Banh Mi Pizza:  This untraditional pizza is inspired by the Vietnamese sandwich called banh mi. While you won’t find Thai curry paste on banh mi, we think it adds just the right amount of seasoning and spice to the spread for this pizza.
 Thai Peanut Curry Noodles: Curry paste delivers a spicy kick-in-the-pants to a bowl of peanut noodles. If you haven’t tried kohlrabi yet, here’s your excuse to buy it. The bulbous vegetable is related to broccoli and Brussels sprouts, but has a more mild, sweet flavor and fabulous crunch.
 Shrimp Kebabs with Curry-Coconut Glaze:  Try this Thai shrimp skewer recipe alongside quinoa and stir-fried broccoli. Having a party? Double or triple the recipe and serve them up as an appetizer.

Every five years, the USDA releases the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (aka what we all should be eating). 
In advance of the official release, an advisory committee publishes its suggestions for what should become the Dietary Guidelines. That report came out last week. 


Although some vociferous voices have criticized the guidelines, well-respected, highly credentialed nutrition experts have also applauded them (see  here, here and here).
I’m in that kudos camp—and here are, in my opinion, some of the most noteworthy conclusions from the report. 
1. You can eat eggs. And shrimp. For years, we’ve been told to be mindful of—and limit—how much cholesterol we get from our food. That meant items like eggs and shrimp felt taboo. The logic went like this: dietary cholesterol would raise blood cholesterol. Turns out there isn’t enough science to support that line of thinking.
2. Steer clear of too much sugar. This might not be news to you. And, in fact, we’ve written about the harms of eating too much added sugar here and here. So it’s just awesome that our national diet advice is following suit and warning all Americans to limit their added sugar intake. 
3. Cut out refined carbs. Also known as white carbs. This too might not be groundbreaking to you. The health benefits of whole grains are well documented. So let’s give the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) a pat on the back for identifying refined grains as “detrimental” to our health. 
4. One diet doesn’t fit all. This is my favorite takeaway. To lower your risk of heart disease and of becoming overweight or obese, the draft guidelines don’t point us to one narrow diet or a combination of single nutrients. Instead they encourage a general healthy diet pattern. How you achieve this diet is up to you! 
David Katz, M.D., an EatingWell advisor, summed it up beautifully: “It leaves people the latitude required to wind up loving the food that loves them back.… For today, we at least now have recommendations, and the promise of official guidelines, that emphasize wholesome foods in sensible combinations, rather than isolated nutrients—which for far too long have unbalanced our diets, like a tail that wags the dog.”  
5. Consider the environmental impact of foods. Critics have attacked the DGAC’s move on this one, saying they are nutrition experts, not environmental experts. And while that criticism is fair, you cannot separate the topics of what to eat for your health and what to eat for the health of the planet. They need to be considered in conjunction. It’s refreshing to see the advisory committee take this on and encourage Americans to eat more plant-based foods as well as provide guidance on seafood choices, among other suggestions.
6. Pump up the produce!  That’s right, we still need to eat more fruits and vegetables. And the draft Dietary Guidelines are really hitting that message hard. But here’s the good news: adding more produce to your diet makes it pretty likely that you’ll be getting key nutrients—like vitamins A and C, folate, magnesium, fiber and potassium—that the guidelines say most Americans fall short on.

Former QPR midfielder Joey Barton expressed his desire to sign for a ‘real football project’ after being released by the  relegated West London side.
The Hoops endured a season to forget back in England’s top flight, finishing bottom of the Premier League table and returning to the Championship at the first time of asking.
Barton, along with several other senior squad members, was released after the climax to the campaign, and the 23-year-old hinted at a few regrets about his time at Loftus Read.
“I’ve been on record before – I joined QPR from the outset on reasons that I swore I wouldn’t do again,” Barton told Drivetime.
“I just want a real football project and to enjoy my football again. With the manner of the relegation – it was disappointing not go down fighting – I just wanted to get away from it and revaluate things.”
Unlike many other fellow professionals, the former Manchester City and Newcastle midfielder has embarked on a rigorous warm weather training regime rather than going on holiday, and he revealed he has a number of options at his disposal.
“I’ve spoken to a number of teams and there are a few options on the table,” Barton added.

Ex-QPR midfielder Joey Barton believes former team-mate Charlie Austin can lay down a claim for an England attacking berth after earning a first international call up.
The Hoops striker excelled in a brilliant breakthrough Premier League season, although his 18 goals proved merely academic as the West London side were relegated back to the Championship at the first time of asking.
Austin’s form was rewarded by England manager Roy Hodgson for the double header with Ireland and Slovenia, and Barton feels the striker has the ability to make an impression, despite being surrounded by goalscoring pedigree.
“At the minute it looks like Harry Kane’s position, but Charlie has the ability to lay down that claim,” the former Manchester City and Newcastle midfielder told Drivetime.
“His goal record speaks for itself. 18 goals for a side that finished bottom of the table is a phenomenal achievement.”
Spurs striker Kane has had a similarly stunning induction to top flight football, and asserted himself as an England starter after making his bow against Slovenia in March with a debut goal.
Austin will be hoping for a similar impact, and Barton is convinced he has the mentality to develop his game to even high levels than he showcased this season.
He said: “The goalscoring ability is natural, you can’t really train for that. The other part of his game – the holding up and lone striker role – he has to improve and he knows he has to improve.
“He always takes on board people’s advice. It’s a fairytale story and it’s great to see him in the England squad and doing well.”

Liverpool continue to look for summer bargains with Bolton''s out-of-contract goalkeeper Adam Bogdan reportedly under consideration.
Manager Brendan Rodgers wants to bring in someone to challenge Simon Mignolet, who regained the number one spot in December after briefly being dropped following a number of unconvincing performances.
Injury to Brad Jones afforded the Belgium international a quicker-than-expected return to the side on Boxing Day and, with Jones now out of contract, the only other goalkeeper in the first-team squad is only Wales Under-21 international Danny Ward.
Bodgan is set to leave Bolton after reportedly not responding to the club''s offer of an improved contract.
At 27 and with 19 caps for Hungary, who he is currently on international duty with, he is a player Liverpool are interested in.
"I am confident that soon will decide my fate," he told Nemzeti Sport back in his homeland.
"My goal is to play at a higher level but it also depends on where you get a chance.
"We''ll see, everything is decided in the next week or two."
The Reds have already agreed a deal to sign Manchester City midfielder James Milner, who becomes a free agent at the end of the month, and are also at an advanced stage in talks with England Under-21 striker Danny Ings, whose contract expires with Burnley on June 30.
Ings will command a fee in compensation because of his age but Liverpool are hoping to agree a suitable deal with the Clarets for between £5million and £6million - otherwise the valuation will be made by a tribunal.

Prime Minister David Cameron is urging a global crackdown on the "cancer" of corruption in the wake of Fifa bribery allegations.
He will use the G7 summit in Germany to call for an international effort to clean up government and business.
And he will condemn the international "taboo" on pointing the finger at corrupt institutions.
Fourteen people have been charged by the US over alleged corruption at world football''s governing body.
The US justice department alleges that the 14 accepted bribes and kickbacks estimated at more than $150m (£97m) over a 24-year period.
British officials said David Cameron would speak of a "cancer of corruption that poisons and stifles" the progress the G7 hopes to make on development and growth, and that the kind of scrutiny being applied to Fifa should not be restricted to the footballing body. 
He is not, however, expected to name organisations and businesses that he would like to see put under the spotlight.
The UK prime minister will join US President Barack Obama, French President Francois Hollande, Italian PM Matteo Renzi, Canadian PM Stephen Harper and Japanese PM Shinzo Abe for the two-day G7 summit, hosted at Schloss Elmau in the Bavarian Alps by Germany''s Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Mrs Merkel has put climate change and sustainable development at the top of the agenda for the annual summit of the world''s leading industrialised economies, which gets under way on Sunday.
The talks will also focus on growth, security and the threat from terrorism and disease epidemics.
But Mr Cameron will argue that the issue of corruption has a bearing on all these areas and must be discussed openly as part of the talks.
He will cite World Bank estimates that corruption adds 10% to business costs worldwide, with the equivalent of one trillion US dollars (£650bn) paid in bribes every year.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) believes corruption costs about 5% of global GDP annually, while in developing countries it can add 25% to the cost of procurement, Mr Cameron will say.
Seven of the 10 countries considered to be the most corrupt in sub-Saharan Africa are also in the bottom 10 on the human development index and infant mortality is twice as high in countries with the most corruption as in those with the least.
Mr Cameron will say that there is an onus on world leaders to do what they can to tackle the issue.
He will call for action in the coming months to focus the efforts of the various international organisations tasked with combating corruption to ensure that they are working effectively with one another.
Anti-corruption measures should be at the heart of the new United Nations development goals for the coming 15 years, due to be agreed in September, he will say.

A safer test for Down''s syndrome that reduces the risk of miscarriage could soon be available on the NHS.
One in every 200 women loses her baby after an amniocentesis, in which the fluid around the developing foetus is tested for genetic disorders. 
A trial at Great Ormond Street Hospital of the new test - for fragments of foetal DNA in the mother''s blood - suggested it could be cost-effective. 
The NHS is to decide if it should be added to screening for Down''s syndrome.
About 750 babies are born with Down''s syndrome in the UK each year. 
All pregnant women are offered testing for genetic disorders. 
Initially an ultrasound scan and chemicals in the mother''s blood are used to assess the likelihood of the baby having Down''s.
Anyone calculated to have up to a one-in-150 chance of a baby with Down''s syndrome is offered an amniocentesis - in which a needle is used to extract a sample of amniotic fluid, which surrounds the foetus.
But those women, of whom most would probably not have a baby with Down''s, need to decide whether to have the risky test.
Fragments of the developing foetus''s DNA naturally end up in the mother''s bloodstream.
"Non-invasive prenatal testing" - or NIPT - uses this DNA to test for major genetic abnormalities.
It is already used in nearly 100 countries, but Great Ormond Street Hospital has assessed how it could be used on the NHS.
Prof Lyn Chitty, who led the trial, told the BBC: "It''s a much more accurate test, so it''s 99% accurate for Down''s syndrome so it reduces the number of [invasive] tests significantly.
"In our study it reduced the number of invasive tests by more than 80%."
However, it does not completely eliminate the need for an amniocentesis.
Anyone who has a positive NIPT test result would still need final confirmation with an amniocentesis. 
One anonymous mother who took part in the trial said: "We probably wouldn''t have done [invasive testing] because there''s a risk of miscarriage. 
"I think that we were very lucky, it''s enabled us to make an informed choice about what happens for the rest of our lives."
Prof Chitty, who will present data from the trial involving 2,500 mothers at the European Society of Human Genetics conference, said the measure could be cost-effective. 
While the blood test is costly, it could also help the NHS save money by reducing the number of expensive amniocenteses.
She also rejected the idea that the extra testing would lead to more abortions. 
Prof Chitty said the trial showed that many women who would have refused an amniocentesis chose to have the safer test to help them prepare.
The UK''s National Screening Committee will begin assessing the idea this month.
Dr Anne Mackie, its director of programmes, said: "Before NIPT can be safely introduced we must be sure it is accurate when used on large numbers of women and that there are quality-assessed pathways in place providing the care, support and information women need."
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would each make their own decision on whether to make any recommendations.

Greece''s prime minister has warned international creditors not to impose humiliating terms on his country as it seeks urgently needed bailout funds.
Alexis Tsipras said negotiations were at a "critical" stage, but that the lenders'' proposals were "not realistic".
He was briefing parliament amid growing opposition in his leftist Syriza party to the creditors'' proposals.
Earlier Greece delayed Friday''s €300m (£216m) debt repayment to the IMF.
Mr Tsipras described the EU-IMF lenders'' plan as a "bad moment for Europe" and a "bad negotiating trick". 
He accused Greece''s lenders of massively backtracking on measures agreed in recent months, and of failing to see the need for an end to austerity in their latest offer. 
A call for debt relief was a key part of the Greek plan.
€320bn 
Greece''s debt mountain 
€240bn
European bailout
€56bn Greece owes Germany 
177% country''s debt-to-GDP ratio 
25% fall in GDP since 2010 
26% Greek unemployment rate 
The lenders'' proposals were put forward when Mr Tsipras met the head of the eurozone''s finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels this week.
Denouncing their offer on Friday, Mr Tsipras said: "The strangulation of a country is a matter of moral order which conflicts with the founding principles of Europe."
He said the aim of any deal should be "for a solution and not to... humiliate a whole people".
He said his own proposals were the only "realistic" option.
Many of his own MPs are expected to object to any concessions by Athens.
All four scheduled repayments to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in June will now be combined into a single payment at the end of the month.
Special report - Greek debt crisis
Robert Peston - How serious is missed IMF payment?
Mr Tsipras said on Thursday that an agreement with Greece''s international creditors was "in sight", particularly on the key sticking point of primary surpluses - the amount by which tax revenues exceed public spending.
But he said there were "points that no-one would consider as a base for discussion" - citing cuts to pensions and higher sales tax (VAT) for electricity.
Underlining a deep sense of anger among Syriza members, Deputy Social Security Minister Dimitris Stratoulis, who is close to Syriza''s far-left faction, denounced the measures.
"If [the creditors] do not back down from this package of blackmail, the government ...will have to seek alternative solutions, elections," he told Antenna TV.
However, Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis said on Thursday he saw "no reason whatsoever" for Greece to go to snap elections, according to Reuters.
The Greek prime minister spent half an hour in parliament putting sandbags around his main demand: an end to austerity.
Alexis Tsipras said that he was disappointed with the proposals Europe has made this week.
The general outline of these proposals seems pretty clear: Greece should make further cuts and reforms. In exchange, it would get the money it needs to keep going.
But instead, the prime minister told parliament that his own counter-proposal, which protects salaries and benefits, should be accepted. 
European capitals will not see it that way. Negotiators don''t have all that much time left.
If there''s no deal by the end of this month, there''ll be no more bailout money for Greece.
Prime Minister Tsipras is understood to have spoken by phone on Thursday night with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande.
He needs to decide soon whether to agree a deal with the creditors. Failure to do so could trigger a Greek default and a potential exit from the eurozone.
The government must now pay a total of €1.5bn back to the IMF on 30 June, which is also the day on which its bailout deal with the EU and IMF runs out.
However, the total this month Greece actually needs to pay in terms of bills is 6.7bn euros. The rest - 5.2bn euros - is short-term treasury bills.

Millions of rail passengers who suffer travel delays will soon be able to claim refunds in cash, after a major policy change, the BBC has learned.
Up to now most train companies have only offered vouchers as compensation.
The voucher system has long been criticised by consumer groups, as vouchers cannot always be used online or to access the cheapest fares.
The Rail Delivery Group, representing train operators and Network Rail, said the change would come in this summer. 
"Planned changes to the National Rail Conditions of Carriage will enable passengers to claim their compensation in cash, instead of rail vouchers," said a spokesman.
"This will be a welcome move for passengers." 
It is not yet known whether customers with existing vouchers will be able to swap them for cash.
The move marks a major change in policy, as the current voucher system has been in place for around 20 years.
The news was welcomed by Transport Focus, which has campaigned on the issue for some time.
James Daley, a consumer expert with Fairer Finance, called it "a victory for common sense".
It was also welcomed by Budd Shenkin and his wife Ann, two Californian tourists who were frustrated by the voucher system.
After paying for first-class tickets on a train from Inverness to Edinburgh last month, they boarded the train to find no first class available.
When they tried to get a refund at the ticket office, they were told they could only have vouchers - of little use to a couple only in the UK on holiday.
"They sold us seats that didn''t exist - and then wouldn''t give us our money back," said Ann, a retired lawyer.
But her husband Budd said he was pleased to see that good sense had now prevailed.
"Implementation is always an issue, however," he told the BBC.
"Nothing short of putting a credit onto the customer''s credit card without a physical visit to the office should be acceptable."
After being approached by the BBC, ScotRail eventually agreed to refund their money.
However, Transport Focus is still concerned that too few people claim refunds when their trains are delayed.
In a survey published in 2013, it found that 88% of passengers entitled to compensation did not bother to ask for it.
And that''s despite the fact that the rules on compensation have been widely toughened up.
Nearly half of the 26 train operators have adopted the so-called Delay Repay guarantee, which means passengers are entitled to redress after a delay of as little as 30 minutes.
Furthermore, those train companies cannot get out of paying by claiming that the delay was not their fault, because they, in their turn, can claim compensation from Network Rail if the delay was caused by signalling problems or other network issues.
The companies not signed up to Delay Repay usually offer compensation when a train is at least 60 minutes late.

A total of 331 people are now known to have died after a ship overturned in a storm in China''s Yangtze River last Monday, state media said.
Salvagers righted the Eastern Star on Friday after officials said chances of finding anyone alive were slim.
Just 14 of the 456 passengers and crew are known to have survived. More than 100 are still missing.
The tragedy looks set to be China''s worst shipping disaster in more than 60 years of Communist rule.
Why did cruise ship capsize?
Hundreds of the bodies were discovered after emergency workers righted the ship with cranes and raised it above the river''s currents.
Hooks were welded onto the ship and a net stretched around the entire structure in order to lift it.
By first light on Friday, the ship could be seen lying on its side with its name visible just above the water. Xinhua state news agency later tweeted a picture of the righted vessel, its roof apparently crushed. 
Officials said there had been no further signs of life inside the ship, Xinhua news agency reports. 
Chinese President Xi Jinping promised a thorough investigation into the cause of the disaster, after angry relatives protested at the scene.
Authorities tightly controlled access to the site, leading family members and journalists to complain about a lack of information.
Yangtze River tragedy on trip of a lifetime
Could Mei-yu weather front be behind disaster?
Questions raised over Eastern Star''s sinking
Most of the 14 people known to have survived jumped from the ship as it began to sink. Three were rescued by divers from air pockets in the upturned hull.
The cause of the sinking is not yet known, but survivors have spoken of an intense storm which flipped the boat over in minutes. 
The captain and chief engineer, who were among those who escaped, have since been detained.
Maritime agency records showed the ship was investigated for safety violations two years ago. It was held alongside five other vessels in 2013 over safety concerns.
China''s deadliest maritime disaster in recent decades was in November 1999, when the Dashun ferry caught fire and capsized in the sea off Shandong province, killing about 280. 
The Eastern Star could become China''s deadliest boat accident since the SS Kiangya sank off Shanghai in 1948, killing somewhere between 2,750 and 4,000 people.

Four rollercoasters at three theme parks have been shut after a crash at Alton Towers in which 16 people were injured, four seriously. 
The Smiler, which crashed, and Saw, a similar ride at Thorpe Park, would both be shut "for the foreseeable future", owner Merlin Entertainments said.
Two rides at Chessington World of Adventures have also been closed until new safety protocols have been applied. 
Merlin Entertainments said the victims of the crash would "want for nothing".
Two carriages, one of which was empty, crashed on Tuesday, leaving some passengers trapped for four-and-a-half hours. 
Two men, 27 and 18, a woman, 19, and a girl, 17, suffered serious leg injuries and remain in hospital.
Daniel Thorpe, 27, from Buxton underwent surgery on Thursday, the BBC understands.
Vicky Balch, 19, from Leyland in Lancashire, remains in a "critical condition" in hospital, according to her lawyer Paul Paxton.
Ms Balch is expected to make a claim for damages, Mr Paxton said, although the main focus at the moment was on her recovery.
"It is expected that serious consideration will be given to criminal prosecutions. The family are distraught that a fun day out could turn into such a potentially life-changing disaster," he said.
Nick Varney, chief executive of Merlin Entertainments, said it was the "first major accident we''ve had on a ride in the company''s history".
"Our first priority has been to look after the people on that ride," he said.
"We want to do everything we possibly can to support those families [most severely affected].
"We haven''t managed to make contact with all of them and we are desperately trying to do that.
"They will want for nothing in the sense of what they need, be it accommodation, transport anything. 
"And of course there will not be any question of them needing to go through the anguish of arguing for compensation."
Alton Towers will remain closed on Saturday, but bosses hope to reopen the park in the "next few days". The Smiler ride will stay out of action until the cause of the accident is known.
Health and Safety Executive (HSE) inspectors have served a prohibition notice on the ride stopping its use "until action is taken to deal with the cause of the failure".
Mr Varney said there was "no conclusive answer yet", but the firm believed the accident was caused by a "rather unique sequence of events".
It is estimated the park has been losing up to £500,000 a day since Tuesday.
Sam Bailey, 30, from Kent, said she had been in the same row of the Smiler ride only a few days ago as those injured.
"By chance I was sat on the front row of the carriage" she said. 
"It''s crazy to think after seeing the pictures. I happened to be sitting on the same seat as them only a few days earlier."
Ms Bailey was also at Chessington World of Adventure in Surrey on Thursday and said the Dragonsfury ride was shut down soon after 15:00 BST.
The park''s Rattlesnake ride is also closed.
Mr Varney said extra safety protocols had been introduced across Merlin''s theme parks, but it would take a few days to implement those on two Chessington rides as they used "different operating systems".
He said Thorpe Park''s Saw ride had been closed until the cause of the Alton Towers crash is known as it was made by the same manufacturer and was essentially a "very similar ride" to the Smiler.
Merlin Entertainments said it was co-operating fully with the HSE investigation and intended to complete a "thorough appraisal" of its safety processes at Alton Towers "in the near future".
The HSE said carriages involved in the Smiler crash would be removed later and taken to its laboratory in Buxton for further analysis.  
It said the prohibition notice did not affect other rides at Alton Towers.

The US says it faces a "dedicated adversary" and an "ever evolving threat" to the nation''s cyber security, after a major data breach. 
The hacking of federal government computers may have compromised the records of four million employees. 
US officials have blamed China for the attack, but the Chinese have denied any involvement. 
Four million current and former US government employees are being told to take precautions.
They have been told to monitor or close bank accounts, freeze credit reports, and change online passwords. 
Some have spoken to the BBC expressing fears over how their personal information will be used.
"Identity theft is one thing I''m concerned about," said Bryan Sivak, a former technology officer with the Department of Health and Human Services.
"But depending on what information was accessed, I''m more worried about this information being used to illegally access various networks or against individuals directly."
At a White House briefing on Friday, a spokesman said the US faced a "dedicated adversary", and the question of who carried out the attack was the focus of an ongoing FBI investigation. 
J David Cox Sr, president of the largest union representing federal employees, says he "will demand accountability" and push for the information to be secured.
Steve Hodge, a former employee of the Food and Drug Administration told the BBC that "if anyone had possession of this information, they could impersonate me".
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) said it became aware of the breach in April during an "aggressive effort" to update its cyber security systems. 
It said it would be offering those affected 18 months of free credit monitoring and identity theft insurance. 
OPM serves as the human resource department for the federal government. The agency issues security clearances and compiles records of all federal government employees. 
An unnamed US official told the Reuters news agency that some of the stolen information includes security clearances and background checks from as far back as 1985.
Some of the sensitive personal information could be used to access critical weapons systems, according to the official. 
Susan Collins, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the hackers were believed to be based in China.
But China denied there was any official involvement in the attack.
A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington called  the allegations "not responsible, and counterproductive". 
US Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the hack proved the "inadequacy" of cyber strategy.
If China was to blame, then the US cannot "sit idly by", he added, and ways must be found to deter future attacks.
The White House spokesman said President Barack Obama has frequently raised China''s activities in cyber space as a significant source of concern.

Sixty-eight suspected illegal immigrants, including two pregnant women and 15 children, have been found inside four lorries at a port in Essex.
They were discovered during routine Border Force checks at Harwich International Port on Thursday night.
Thirty-five people from Afghanistan, 22 from China, 10 from Vietnam and one Russian were found, at about 22:00 BST.
Four Polish lorry drivers have been arrested on suspicion of facilitating illegal immigration.
They are now being questioned, the Home Office confirmed.
A spokesman said the stowaways were found inside four separate lorries rather than in one container as initially reported.
The pregnant women were among seven people taken to Colchester Hospital as a precaution after they reported abdominal and chest pains. 
Their conditions are described as non life-threatening.
Bernard Jenkin, MP for Harwich and North Essex, said the people were discovered in trucks "full of Polish washing machines", adding the 68 individuals would probably be told to "go home".
He said 94% of trucks go through unchecked and it was therefore possible more migrants got through this way than was known.
A spokeswoman for Stena Line, the operator of the Stena Hollandica ferry that transported the lorries, said the service left the Hook of Holland at 14:15 BST on Thursday.
It is not yet clear where the lorries had been before sailing to Harwich. The ship arrived at the Essex port at 19:45 BST.
Stena Line confirmed all 68 immigrants were in the care of Border Force at Harwich Port.  It is believed those not seeking asylum will be sent home.
Leigh Daynes, executive director of Doctors of the World UK which provides medical aid to undocumented migrants throughout Europe, said: "Over and over we see migrants who have risked life and limb to cross Europe.
"With few safe routes to enter the continent, many more will continue to take dehumanising and perilous journeys like this."
Last August, one man died when 35 Afghan Sikh migrants were found in a container at Tilbury Docks.
They were discovered after dock workers heard banging and screaming coming from one of the containers.
Matthew Broad, from the East of England Ambulance Service, said there appeared to be a "similar pattern" to Thursday''s incident.
"We have experience of dealing with this in Essex, and one of the things we were concerned about was the length of time they''d been in there." 
The tragic deaths, 15 years ago this month, of 58 Chinese people in a lorry which had been searched at Dover was the first, and clearest, indication of an emerging problem: people smuggling. 
Migrants seeking a better life pay criminals to help them reach their destination. 
But the routes, typically through northern Africa and southern Europe, or via Turkey and eastern Europe, are hazardous.
In the year to April, almost 41,000 so-called "clandestine" migrants were detected - the vast majority picked up by British staff at joint border controls in northern France and Belgium. 
But there''s anecdotal evidence that because security is so stringent there, migrants are finding other ways to enter the UK: nearly 1,500 were discovered at ports in Britain - including Harwich. 
However, we may never know how many have got in without the authorities finding out.

Tariq Aziz, known as the face of Saddam Hussein''s regime on the world stage for many years, has died in an Iraqi hospital, officials say.
Aziz, 79, served as foreign minister and deputy prime minister and was a close adviser to the former leader.
He was sentenced to death by the Iraqi Supreme Court in 2010 for the persecution of religious parties under Saddam''s rule but was never executed.
He surrendered to US troops in 2003 shortly after the fall of Baghdad.
A local health official told reporters that he was taken to hospital from prison after suffering a heart attack. Initial reports said he had died in prison. 
He had long been in poor health, suffering from heart and respiratory problems, high blood pressure and diabetes, and his family repeatedly called for his release from custody.
His wife, Violet, had visited him in prison on Thursday, their daughter Zeinab told the AP news agency.
She said her father had suffered several strokes that left him confined to a wheelchair and unable to speak during her parents'' final meeting. 
"He didn''t move. He couldn''t talk. He didn''t say a word to her. He just looked at her," said Zeinab, adding: "It is so sad that he had to go this way."
Aziz, who was known for his black-rimmed glasses and love of cigars, first came to prominence while serving as foreign minister during the first Gulf War in 1991.  
As a Christian in a mainly Sunni Muslim government, he was not considered a member of Saddam Hussein''s innermost circle. 
A fluent English speaker, he played a vocal role before the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, meeting Pope John Paul II in the Vatican to call for peace. 
But when Baghdad fell, his lack of influence was reflected in his lowly ranking as the eight of spades in the US military''s famous "deck of cards" used to identify the most-wanted players in Saddam''s regime.
Tariq Aziz was one of the most visible of Saddam Hussein''s lieutenants and, it seems, one of the most loyal. 
He frequently represented Iraq on the international stage, speaking fluent English and giving a monstrous regime an urbane, often charming face. And like Saddam, he was often seen puffing on fat Cuban cigars.
When Iraq found itself in dock, as it did after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, it invariably fell to Tariq Aziz to explain Saddam''s actions to an exasperated world. He did it doggedly, often infuriatingly, for decades.
As an ethnic Chaldean from northern Iraq, he was also the only Christian member of Saddam''s entourage, which made him useful as an envoy for an secular regime. It also made him an outsider in Baghdad. 
Western diplomats never doubted his loyalty to Saddam, but wondered how much he really knew about his master''s secrets.

In 2009, Aziz was sentenced to 15 years for the execution of 42 Iraqi traders who had been accused of manipulating food prices while Iraq was subject to international trade sanctions.
Five months later, he was sentenced to another seven years in prison for his role in the forced displacement of Kurds.
Despite being sentenced to death in 2010, there never seemed any huge pressure to carry out the sentence, according to BBC Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher.

More than 700 species of wild plants - almost half of the native flora of the British Isles - are found on road verges, according to a study. 
Many plants once found in meadows now only thrive beside roads, where they provide essential habitat for insects, says charity Plantlife International.
But it says one in 10 of the plants is at risk of extinction, in part because councils cut verges too early.
Local authorities say shorter verges are safer for drivers and pedestrians.
Dr Trevor Dines, botanical specialist for the charity, said more than 97% of meadows had been destroyed in England since the 1930s, with road verges becoming the last stretches of natural habitat for wildlife such as bees and other insects.
"Most of our farmland is now hostile to many of our wild plants and other wildlife due to the loss of wild flower meadows and the use of herbicides and fertilisers," he told BBC News.
"The roadside verges are often the last refuge for wild flowers and the wildlife there depends on them.
"It''s almost as if plants have been squeezed out of farmland and now they''re being squeezed out of road verges from bad management."
The Local Government Association has said keeping road verges well-maintained means motorists have a good line of sight and allows pedestrians to walk more safely alongside busy roads.
Plantlife International says road verges are of particular importance to rare plants such as Deptford pink, tower mustard and spiked rampion.
They also act as wildlife corridors and provide pollen and nectar for bees, butterflies and moths.
The wild plant conservation charity says many of Britain''s road verges are being cut down in full flower threatening the wildflowers and the wildlife that depends on them.
It is calling on members of the public to sign a petition urging councils to do more to enhance the wildlife value of road verges.
Its management principles for road verges include:
Dr Dines added: "If we just give them a chance, wildflowers can return."

As well as the devastating loss of human life in Saturday''s earthquake, Nepalis, and the world, have lost parts of the country''s unique cultural heritage.
Irina Bokova, the Director-General of the UN''s cultural organisation, Unesco, said there had been "extensive and irreversible damage" at the world heritage site in the Kathmandu valley.
Seven monument zones in the valley make up the world heritage site.
The three urban zones at the site are Durbar squares - meaning "noble courts" - in the settlements of Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Patan.
Ms Bokova describes these three complexes as "almost fully destroyed".
The four other zones are religious sites: Buddhist stupas [monuments] at Swayambhunath and Boudhanath and Hindu temple complexes at Pashupatinath and Changu Narayan.
Unesco said in a statement that it would be sending international experts to assess the damage to the sites in the Kathmandu valley.
The Durbar Square in Kathmandu''s Old City is a mesh of palaces, courtyards and temples.
Unesco calls it "the social, religious and urban focal point" of the Nepalese capital.
The main temple in Bhaktapur''s square lost its roof, while the 16th Century Vatsala Durga temple, famous for its sandstone walls and gold-topped pagodas, was demolished by the quake.
Patan, or Lalitpur, is across the Bagmati river to the east of Kathmandu.
The city was founded in the 3rd Century.
The Buddhist temple complex at Swayambhunath, founded in the 5th Century, has also been damaged. 
Video footage showed the toppled facade of one of the buildings, with the prayer flags surrounding it still fluttering in the wind.
But the iconic central stupa, with its gazing eyes of the Buddha, still stands.
There are reports that the Boudhanath stupa has sustained some damage, though details are not yet clear.
It is the largest stupa in Nepal.
The shrine at the Pashupatinath Hindu religious complex has not been damaged in the disaster, a devotee at the temple told the Indian Express.
Cremations are being held on the site continuously, the paper reports.
This landmark has been reduced to a stump by Saturday''s quake.
Built by Nepal''s first prime minister in 1832, the site, also known as the Bhimsen Tower, was popular among tourists who would climb up more than 200 steps to view Kathmandu from the top.
It is unclear whether all of these ancient monuments can, or will, be rebuilt.
Historian Prushottam Lochan Shrestha told the ekantipur.com website: "We have lost most of the monuments that had been designated as World Heritage Sites in Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur [Patan]. 
"They cannot be restored to their original states."
And yet many buildings that were destroyed in Nepal''s 1934 earthquake were reconstructed, including the Dharahara tower.

In a quiet room full of the glistening trophies he''s won, Lee Young-ho rolled up the right sleeve on his grey jumper.
A scar, half an inch wide, stretched from just above the elbow and up over his shoulder.
"Our company paid for full medical expenses, so he had an operation," explained his coach, Kang Doh Kyung.
"[He] is the best player in StarCraft and has won everything in this field and is still going strong."
Repetitive strain had injured Mr Lee''s muscles, deforming them and making surgery the only option to save his illustrious career.
Holding his arm out so I could have a proper gawp, Mr Lee paused.
"It''s like a badge of honour," he said.
It seemed like the confirmation I''d been expecting - that gaming in South Korea had reached a dangerous place, where professionals and amateurs alike were destroying their lives and their bodies.
But Mr Kang sees it very differently. They''re athletes, he argues, and injuries happen.
One of his colleagues later suggested that if I''d been interviewing the world''s most-decorated marathon champion, I wouldn''t be surprised if they had damaged knees.
Nor would I suggest a footballer needing surgery was "too far", the phrase I''d used to describe Mr Lee''s arm.
He had a point.
Professional gaming - e-sport - is a huge deal in South Korea. There''s a government department dedicated to its development. 
These gamers are like professional footballers, their matches broadcast - on TV and online - in English as well as Korean.
The best earn hundreds of thousands of pounds every year: a mixture of salaries, prize money and sponsorship deals.
Mr Lee is a Starcraft player for KT Rolster, one of South Korea''s bigger teams. The scar is a result of being at the top of his game for 10 years.
Read more stories from the South Korea Direct season:
Whatever happened to Psy and K-pop''s bid to conquer the world?
The woman who liberated Korean housewives
In Pictures: Fish, fruit and veg in South Korea''s markets
How good are Kim Jong-un''s hackers?
On the day I visited, KT Rolster''s Starcraft players were training hard to be just like Mr Lee.
The noise of their practice produced an almost hypnotic tap-tap-tap-tap backing track in a room which resembled the kind of place you''d be subjected to when sitting a computer-based exam.
Each PC in its own cubicle, gamers with their headphones on, the room screamed "do not disturb".
The difference here is that these cubicles feel lived in. Family pictures, the remains of snacks, and the odd toothbrush. And then there''s the gifts. A lot of gifts. 
The professional gamers are overwhelmingly male, but their most-obsessive fans are female, lavishing the boys with the kind of attention otherwise reserved for the singing K-Pop stars, the country''s other booming entertainment export.
But unlike the fad of Gangnam Style, e-sports is something South Korea feels it can bring to the world. 
"I believe that e-sport has plenty of potential [to be regarded as a proper sport], although perhaps not as much as physical games," Mr Kang said.
"E-sports is in the process of becoming a mental sport like chess."
Down the hallway - and past a room filled with bottles of "sports" drink Pocari Sweat, another sponsor - I found the training room for KT Rolster''s League of Legends team.
League of Legends - LoL - is arguably the biggest of the e-sports titles and is all about teamwork and group strategy.
The team here joked about going out and drinking beer - and teased about who got the most, and the least, gifts.
As well as training together, the teams live together in some digs a short walk from the training office.
I''d expected a room full of gadgets and other technology. These are big gamers, after all. But no - aside from a TV, there was very little in the way of gaming entertainment.
Here, their charming housekeeper holds fort, and does what she can to keep the team healthy.
"They spend most of their time sitting with little exercise," she said, while washing up, "so I wanted to avoid cooking high-calorie foods, but they love naughty foods like that."
She loves them, she told me. "They''re adorable."
At the top-end of gaming, the players are undeniably well looked after, healthy and happy - even if the gruelling routine means they clearly don''t enjoy playing anymore. It''s work. 
But for the non-professional, the impact heavy gaming is having on the health and social lives of young Koreans is of great concern to many.
After visiting KT Rolster, I went to another part of Seoul to visit what is known as a PC Bang. They''re all over South Korea - internet cafes, essentially, but with high-end gaming PCs. Hundreds of them, in a big room kitted out like a club - with its own bar. It''s open 24 hours a day.
There have been numerous instances where gamers have died in these PC Bangs. They are rare, but make global headlines.
South Korea has made numerous attempts to curb the amount of online gaming its young are playing. In 2011, it passed the Shutdown Law - dubbed the Cinderella Law - which prevented children aged 16 or below from playing online games between 10:30pm and 6:00am.
The rules were later amended to allow parents to make their own choice about when gaming access should be curtailed in the home.
The country is the world leader in treatment for all sorts of technology dependency, but gaming is, by far, the most common issue. It''s one that has parents literally dragging their children to addiction centres set up all over South Korea.
At KT Rolster, coach Mr Kang is responsible for looking after his team''s wellbeing - but he also recognised the negativity around hardcore gaming.
"When people immerse themselves in something and become addicted to it, then they can cross the line.
"Our bodies might be very tired or in poor condition. These things happen not only while playing games. Even when people work out, some people can have a heart attack."
He stopped, keen to move on from what he saw as a predictable, perhaps tedious, line of questioning.
During my time with KT Rolster my point of view flip-flopped between seeing gaming as either serious business, or a serious problem.
With the relentless tap-tap-tap of keyboards still echoing in my ears, I came to the only reasonable conclusion I could: it''s both.

With mounting deficits, an ageing population and £22bn of "efficiency savings" to find in the next five years, the NHS is facing a monumental task.
This is reflected by the fact that the opening weeks of this government have been dominated by initiatives to get the health service back on an even keel by driving down costs by targeting areas such as spending on agency staff.
But dig a little deeper and there is a fascinating parallel debate going on about just how ambitious and radical the health service should be. 
It centres on this: to what extent should the NHS think outside the box as a way of preventing ill-health?
There was a sense of this during last week''s annual conference of the NHS Confederation, the body which represents health service managers.
NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens spoke about the need to focus on health as well as ill-health. He cited the example of child obesity to make his point, saying if this was not tackled it would lead to a tide of new cases of cancer, heart disease and diabetes. He urged the NHS to "rattle the cage and try something different".
But he could have chosen a range of other issues from smoking to drinking. The theme cropped up again in a separate debate on the devolution of public spending in Greater Manchester. Philip Blond, director of ResPublica, a think tank which has been looking into the case for change in the region, spoke about his desire to see the health service intervening early to prevent people developing health problems in the first place.
He floated the idea of GPs being able to refer patients for home insulation as a way of keeping their homes warm. 
It may sound fanciful, but consider this: research shows cold, damp and dangerous homes cost the NHS £2.5bn a year. Not only do they increase the risk of respiratory problems, but hazards in the home are the most common reasons for falls among the elderly. 
Some areas have already looked at these things. In Liverpool the council and the NHS have been working together on a Healthy Homes Programme since 2009. 
Last year in Sunderland, doctors began offering help with insulation, double-glazing and boilers and started seeing some falls in demand.
There is also growing interest in social prescribing, whereby GPs refer patients on to knitting clubs and fishing groups, as a way of tackling problems such as depression.
Offering befriending services is another novel idea that is growing in popularity as a way of tackling social isolation among the elderly, which is increasingly been recognised as a risk factor for ill-health and death.
In health circles, it all comes under the umbrella of what is called "upstream" intervention.  That is to say supporting people before their conditions worsen and they end up in hospital or a care home, which are the two most expensive ends of the health and care sectors.
This agenda requires the NHS to work with local partners, particularly councils. The big unknown though - as the pressure on the service intensifies in the coming years - is whether there will be the breathing space for it to do so.

Iran is a bona fide superpower in global energy markets. Or rather it would be if reserves in the ground were the measuring stick. 
Taking oil and gas together, only Russia can boast of greater riches.
The potential to be a major gas exporter, then, is huge - were it not, that is, for the small matter of sanctions.
This rather obvious point is not lost on President Hasan Rouhani, who has wasted little time in repairing relations with the West, with one eye firmly on future oil and gas revenues to help bolster his country''s ailing economy.
His efforts are very likely to be rewarded in the coming months, as a nuclear deal with the US, the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China that would end sanctions moves ever closer.
Iran would then be free, in theory, to flood global markets with huge quantities of gas, offering an alternative supplier to energy hungry nations across the world and dramatically transforming the global geopolitical landscape in the process.
"A deal may not be agreed by this month''s deadline, but it has to happen this year," says Jamie Ingram at research group IHS. "There is so much political will on both sides that an extension of two months could be sufficient."
Such a ground-breaking deal would bring a swift end to Iran''s enforced isolation.
The country currently produces about 165 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas a year, of which a little less than 10bcm is exported to Turkey, Azerbaijan and Armenia.
It also imports gas from Turkmenistan, but cut back last year to the point where the country is now a net exporter of gas for the first time. 
Considering Russia exports almost 150bcm to Europe and has signed deals for a further potential 70bcm with China, Iran''s exports are insignificant on the global stage.
But the country is ramping up production fast and is set to produce about 250bcm by 2018, according to Dr Elham Hassanzadeh from Iran consultancy Energy Pioneers. This additional capacity will come from the South Pars gas field Iran shares with Qatar, the biggest of its kind in the world. Beyond 2018, there are already plans for many more phases of development, both at South Pars and other fields such as North Pars and Kish.
But most of this new gas will go towards satisfying domestic demand. The government is keen to reduce the Iranian power sector''s reliance on oil by increasing gas use, in order both to free up oil for exports, generating much needed revenue, and to reduce CO2 emissions. After all, oil does not require huge investment in pipelines or liquefaction to sell abroad. More energy will also be needed to help fuel economic growth that has been hampered by years of sanctions, mismanagement and corruption.
In the coming years, therefore, Dr Hassanzadeh estimates there will be between 30-50bcm of gas left over for exports each year - a relatively small total compared with overall production, but still a significant amount that equates roughly to Russia''s annual gas exports to Germany.
Most of this is likely to stay in the Middle East. As Dr Hassanzadeh says, "Iran will focus on the regional market - Iraq, Oman and Kuwait. It will reach out to its neighbours first".
Indeed the country signed a gas supply deal with Iraq in 2013 and the pipeline between the two is all but complete. It is also negotiating the route of a separate pipeline to Oman following a similar deal last year.
The focus will then turn to Pakistan and India. Iran has been talking with Pakistan about a gas pipeline for 20 years and agreement was finally reached in 2010. But while Iran has finished construction on its pipeline to the border, financing problems and political pressure from the US means Pakistan has yet to start.
Meanwhile, India is not willing to commit to importing gas through Pakistan as relations between the two are too volatile, so liquefied natural gas (LNG) would seem a more likely option. While this is certainly feasible, building liquefaction plants takes many years and billions of dollars of investment, and with a surplus of LNG in the world pushing prices lower, particularly with the US and Australia set to increase exports massively in the coming years, Iran may find energy companies willing to stump up the money hard to come by.
Next, attention will turn to Europe. "Iran is keen to set up as a competitor to Russia, so Europe is a consideration," says Jamie Ingram.
But again cost will be an inhibiting factor. Dr Hassanzadeh estimates that a pipeline to Europe would cost between $5bn-$8bn, and only a consortium of international companies would be able to raise that kind of finance. Again, with international gas prices low, persuading them to invest on such a grand scale could prove difficult for the foreseeable future.
And especially so given Iran has historically driven a hard bargain for its gas.
"The main hurdle in Iran''s gas export ambitions has always been price," says Valerie Marcel from the Chatham House think tank in London.
"They need to lock in customers who are willing to pay the price the Iranians want, and without a firm commitment from the buyer, no infrastructure will be built."
Cheap global natural gas prices could scupper a deal in the short term, but this has not stopped Iran from laying the groundwork - Tehran has been entertaining international energy companies throughout the past 12 months in anticipation of an end to sanctions.
And longer term, the overriding strategic benefits to both sides cannot be ignored - Europe is looking to wean itself off Russian gas, while Iran is looking for diplomatic leverage that would make the re-imposition of sanctions far harder to countenance.
As Dr Hassanzadeh says, "we are a very ambitious nation", and one, like many others, that is eager to gain influence on the international stage. Its huge reserves of natural gas offer a tantalising opportunity to do just that.

Murder and violent crime rates have risen in multiple US cities since the beginning of 2015, after falling for two decades. Some have put this down to a so-called Ferguson effect, referring to the protests against perceived police brutality, that sometimes became violent. Could that be true?
There are no national figures on crime in the US available yet for 2015, but some cities have released their own figures.
In New York City, the murder rate has gone up by 20% in 2015 compared with the first few months of 2014. Mayor Bill de Blasio called a special news conference at which he acknowledged the increase, but said it could be contained. He said he had faith in the New York Police Department that they will "turn the tide".
In other cities, there are similar increases reported. In Baltimore, murders are up 37% and in Los Angeles, violent crime is up by 27% (although murders are down 2%). In Houston, murders are up nearly 50% so far this year.
This is a term coined by St Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson, whose police officers had been one of the forces dealing with the summer protests and riots in Ferguson, Missouri, following the fatal shooting of black teenager Michael Brown. 
He said in November his police officers had been drawing back from everyday enforcement due to fears they could be charged. As a result, he said, the "criminal element is feeling empowered".
The phrase was repeated recently by Heather MacDonald, a fellow at the US Manhattan Institute, in a piece for the Wall Street Journal. 
The Ferguson effect, she said, was taking hold across the country "under the onslaught of anti-cop rhetoric". 
Multiple police officers Ms MacDonald spoke to told her police morale is at an all-time low and they are now worried about being charged, recorded and assaulted while trying to do their jobs and keep communities safe.
"Unless the demonisation of law enforcement ends, the liberating gains in urban safety will be lost," she wrote.
Baltimore''s police boss, Anthony Batts, said the riots had another effect on crime. Scores of pharmacies had been looted and the surge in the supply of drugs has "thrown off the balance" between gangs in the city, he said.
"There''s enough narcotics on the streets of Baltimore to keep it intoxicated for a year," he said.
The Ferguson effect is an unlikely reason, said Jeffery Ulmer, associate head of the Department of Sociology and Criminology at Penn State University in State College, Pennsylvania. 
"Is it possible that somehow high-profile police shootings have angered some local populations and caused a rise in violent crime of all kinds in the last few months? Yes. Do I find that scenario likely nationwide? No, not at all."
More likely, he said, is that local forces are at play.
Violent crime rates are often in response to major changes in policing, but are mostly driven by social factors such as the size of the youth population, the amount of socioeconomic disadvantage and social disorganisation in a given city.
Violent crime being up in NYC is related to the decrease in "stop and frisk", said Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The New York City Police Department''s historical main tactic for stopping people has significantly decreased after the way it was exercised was deemed unconstitutional. 
"Inevitably, there was a trade off," said Mr Blumstein. "[Stop and Frisk] was certainly a deterrent effect to carrying a gun in the street."
New York City''s historic drop in crime since the 1980s is "astonishing", said Mr Blumstein, but continuing downward trends cannot go on forever.
Mayor de Blasio said summer was also to blame - last year saw an uptick in crime at the end of spring and beginning of summer for New York City as well. Researchers from the University of North Carolina found a correlation between higher temperatures and violent crime rates in a 2004 study. 
Violent crime is not going up everywhere. Philadelphia has seen a 41% decrease in murders since 2007.
Short-term spikes are statistically unreliable, especially if they come after a long-term decline, and could just be a blip, said Dr James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston.
"It''s a ridiculous silly game of focusing too much on too little, trying to ascribe it to something like the impact of [events in] Ferguson," said Mr Fox. "None of these statistics are reliable."
A wider window of statistics would be much more reliable than a handful of figures representing January to May of this year, he said.
That flattened feeling police officers are having in Baltimore? It will pass, Dr Fox said.
"I don''t want to minimise the tragedy of so many dying... but the sky is not falling," he said.
Some of the rises in violent crime so far this year are indeed striking, but I understand there have been similarly impressive falls in other cities. 
It is usually a mistake to declare a trend based on a few months of figures for a handful of cities. It is also difficult to blame this selection of figures on a nationwide problem with US policing, or anything else for that matter. 
I''m sure the relevant police departments are looking at these figures very carefully, but we will need considerably more data over a longer period to be able to draw any meaningful conclusions.

The British sculptor Anish Kapoor has defended a piece of art in the French palace of Versailles that has been called "dirty" and "gross".
The installation, called Dirty Corner, sits in the grounds outside the palace. 
Mr Kapoor said in a French interview it signified "the vagina of the queen coming into power" - but later said the work was open to interpretation.
The Versailles palace was the home of Marie Antoinette, the 18th Century queen of France.
In a tweet, Versailles'' mayor said the award-winning artist had "slipped up".
A German tourist, Dunja, told Reuters: "It''s confusing, a big vagina and a palace.
"It''s one of the most famous places in Paris and I just wanted to see it and I saw this building, this statue, and I don''t know what it is."
Another tourist, Megan, from the US, said: "When you think you''re coming to Versailles you''d expect like classic French, maybe a big statue of some Roman god but this just seems dirty, gross."
The piece has come in for criticism, but also praise, by female academics in the French press.
Mr Kapoor said on Friday he was misquoted in an earlier interview.
"A work has multiple interpretive possibilities," he said.
"Inevitably, one comes across the body, our bodies and a certain level of sexuality. But it is certainly not the only thing it is about."
The large metal sculpture is only part of Mr Kapoor''s installation in Versailles. He also installed large mirrors, and a wall defaced by paint seemingly shot from a cannon.
Mr Kapoor is a former Turner Prize winner whose work has been shown around the world. 
He is best known for the Orbital Tower at the heart of the Olympic Park in London.

A tricky GCSE maths question stumped thousands of students - but inspired them to take to Twitter to vent their anger and frustration.
The equation in Thursday''s Edexcel exam was on the probability of taking two orange sweets from a bag. 
By the afternoon the topic was trending on Twitter and online petitions were set up calling on the board to lower the grade boundaries when marking.
Edexcel''s owner Pearson said it aimed to "test the full range" of abilities.
But it said it would ensure students were "treated fairly" when the papers are marked.
It is understood that Edexcel stands by the difficulty level of the exam paper, and that the sweets question was targeted at students aiming for A and A* grades.
Some pupils complained the sweets question appeared to be of a higher standard than those in past papers they had used to revise.
One student, writing on the Change.org petition website, said: "All past papers were similar in a way and they are the resources... that were used by students all through the country to help them with this paper... a lot of people have done badly and would appreciate a retake of a new test or lower grade boundaries." 
About 500,000 teenagers sat the exam across England, and some took to Twitter to say they felt all was going well until they began the second paper in the maths non-calculator exam. 
The question that attracted the most comments was about a girl called Hannah taking a sweet from a bag at random, and the students were asked to prove the equation: "Show that n²-n-90=0".
But others also highlighted questions where they were asked about the cheapest plants at a garden centre, and the volume of two pieces of cheese, as being particularly difficult.
Some of the students are also about to sit an Edexcel statistics paper and they took to Twitter again later to speculate on whether it would prove as challenging.
A Pearson spokesperson said: "Our exam papers are designed by an experienced team of expert teachers with a deep understanding of the subject matter. 
"They make sure our papers are set at the appropriate level to test the full range of students'' abilities. 
"In the event that any one paper turns out to be more or indeed less challenging than usual, our marking and grading process always ensures students are awarded the grades they deserve."
Ofqual, which regulates exams in England, said it had not been contacted over the Edexcel exam.
Even if Ofqual were contacted, it would expect Edexcel to investigate and deal with any issues in the first instance.
It is understood that Edexcel has only received one formal complaint about the paper so far, and this came form a teacher.

Willow Smith just landed her biggest fashion coup yet, grabbing a spot in Marc Jacobs'' fall 2015 campaign (alongside Cher no less). It might mark the first time Jacobs'' customers have been introduced to Will Smith''s 14-year-old daughter, but the rest of us already know her as a style rebel-icon for the social media generation. If you''ve been paying attention since her "Whip My Hair" days, you''re aware there''s no shortage of fascinating fashion soundbites.

March 2015: In a recent interview given to Billboard, Smith called her style "high-fashion nomad. I could literally climb a mountain and survive a couple nights in nature. That''s a requirement for my clothes because one day I was on the freeway and I saw a mountain, so I literally just pulled over and climbed it."
November 2014: "I like to go to places with my high-fashion things where there are a lot of cameras, so I can just go there and be like, ''Yep, yep, I''m looking so sick,''" she told The New York Times this fall. "But in my regular life, I put on clothes that I can climb trees in."
November 2014: "Flexibility with yourself and your looks shows self confidence. You''re willing to paint on your canvas with whatever comes from within you," she told Wonderland.
August 2011: "I wear anything I feel like," she told Teen Vogue back when she was a youthful 10 years old. "If I want to put on a pair of Converse with a pencil stuck through them, I will." She also revealed fashion is a constant part of the family conversation. "It''s pretty much a regular family. At dinner we talk about ''What did you do today? What did you wear today?''"
March 2011: When she cohosted an episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show, Smith caught flak for being a little bit rude to the talk show legend in the eyes of some viewers. When asked about her closet, she answered back, "Giiiiiiirl. No, it''s like from here to there."
Jacobs introduced Smith''s campaign imagery via Instagram, writing about "those individuals whose creativity, unique vision, and voice [that] inspire all of us." He also revealed that the fall ''15 lineup wouldn''t stop with Cher and Smith, with more to come in the next few weeks.
 Ever since our first Juergen Teller ad in 1998 which featured Kim Gordon on stage wearing my dress, I have always preferred collaborating with the people who inspire me to give new life to the clothes we show on our runway. Over the years we have photographed an incredibly diverse and exceptional group of talented friends and individuals who I greatly admire: Victoria Beckham, Jamie Bochert, Jarvis Cocker, Sofia Coppola, Miley Cyrus, Dakota Fanning, William Eggleston, Jessica Lange, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Stephen Malkmus, Samantha Morton, Kate Moss, Charlotte Rampling, Winona Ryder, Stephanie Seymour, Cindy Sherman, Michael Stipe, and Rufus Wainwright, just to name a few. Beauty, style and talent know no age. It is those individuals whose creativity, unique vision, and voice inspire all of us here to create and express ourselves through our medium: fashion. Photographed by David Sims, this season’s ads feature friends, each of whom evoke a sense of intrigue and inspiration and collectively provoke a true consideration for individuality. Here today I would like to share (not CHER) with you first, the talented, stylish and charming Willow Smith @gweelos Stay tuned over the coming weeks for more

Fashion Me Now, Man Repeller, Song of Style

Take a cue from the stylish ladies above—the possibilities are endless. Bonus? A bathing suit won''t bunch like a tight tank or billow like a fussy tucked-in top.
Allow your bandeau to peek out from underneath a button-down shirt, or give a very special wrapped or ruffled one-piece time to shine—paired with everything from denim cutoffs to midlength skirts. 
Here''s how we''re styling our favorite swimwear this season.

As the lazy days of summer finally roll around, the last thing we want to think about are rules and restrictions. This season, it''s time to kick back and break free from these 12 sartorial shackles—your wardrobe will thank you.
 Rule to Break #1: Horizontal Stripes Aren''t Flattering. When dresses, tops, and bottoms fit well, it doesn''t matter whether they come in stripes or solids—find a great cut (like  Girl With Curves did) that fits you and any pattern can be a fun, flattering summer go-to. 
 
Rule to Break #2: You Can''t Wear Shorts to Work. Take a tip from Hema Persad—a pair of long tailored shorts with a boxy blazer can be a fantastic choice when you crave a break from skirts and dresses.
 
Rule to Break #3: Navy and Black Do Not Go Together. Combining  shades of blue with black—just like Luella & June does here—adds dimension to an otherwise understated outfit.
 
Rule to Break #4: You Can''t Wear Leather in Summer. Try pairing leather shorts with a printed silk blouse for a chic date-night look—Lovely Pepa''s will take her seamlessly from day to night.
 
Rule to Break #5: Ankle Straps Aren''t Flattering. If you''ve always wanted to wear strappy sandals but feel like they make your legs look shorter, skip the mini and try styling them with cropped pants or  a midi skirt instead. Kayture''s outfit proportions here are spot-on.
 
Rule to Break #6: Bikinis Are Sexier Than One-Pieces. You don''t need to wear a two-piece to drop jaws on the beach—there are so many one-piece swimsuits styles available today that would make the cast of Baywatch blush. Look for a diagonal placement print for an extra dose of curve flattery—just like this one from We Wore What.
 
Rule to Break #7: Store Your Boots Until Fall. If you can''t resist wearing your favorite fall ankle boots, throw them on in the sunshine with a minidress or A-line skirt. It works like a charm on Nette Nestea.
 
Rule to Break #8: Wear All Your Whites Before Labor Day. White has become season-less, but it''s all about the fabric that you choose. Wear your boxy linen blouses now and save your white shirtdresses for layering with sweaters when the weather gets colder. Get inspired by Hello Shopping''s look and try white and ivory layered texture-on-texture.
 
Rule to Break #9. Fringe Is for Music Festivals: Fringe doesn''t need to be costume-y. Look for small, refined fringe details on bags and shoes—like the subtle touch on Gal Meets Glam''s suede sandals.
 
Rule to Break #10. Khakis Are for Dads: Khakis can actually be perfect for a casual date night or dinner with friends. Style them with stilettos and a chic clutch—like Haute Inhabit does. Bonus? Loose pants are super-comfy.
 
Rule to Break #11. Sneakers Are for Working Out and Running Errands: We believe in wearing sneakers often—and with pretty much everything. Proof: Agoniiya''s fancy black-and-gold top goes great with Converse.
 
Rule to Break #12. Denim on Denim: Has anyone out there NOT tried pairing denim with denim? What are you waiting for? Try a smart tailored sleeveless top with summer''s staple distressed cutoffs—just like Love Brown Sugar.

Victoria Beckham had a packed house in stitches at the 92nd Street Y in New York City Wednesday night, where she took to the stage with fashion exec Fern Mallis. The hour-long conversation ran the gamut from her Spice Girls audition (she sang "Mein Herr" from Cabaret—"a bit dramatic, but it got me in the group," she says) to David''s marriage proposal 15 years ago ("he asked my dad before he did it, which was very nice and appropriate").
And even after a long day of presenting her resort 2016 collection to buyers and press, Beckham had the caffeinated wit and infectious charm of a woman who believes that anything is possible—with a little bit of girl power. Here are the highlights that will make you love her more than you thought was ever possible.

1. What Her Nickname "Posh" really means: "What Posh actually stands for, is when people used to travel abroad on boats. It stood for Port Out and Starboard Homebut in England, if you go to a nice restaurant, it’s a ''posh'' restaurant, or if you have nice clothes, they''re ''posh'' clothes."
2. Her parents are still crazy in love: "My parents have been together for years and years and years. They’re very happy. My mom and dad still sit in front of the TV and hold hands, which is really really sweet. They''ve always been great parents."
3. Her grandparents kept exotic pets: "I didn’t actually meet the penguin or the monkey...it was when my mom was young."
4. She wanted to fit in at school:  "My dad worked really hard and it was always his ambition to own a Rolls-Royce...So when he got his Rolls-Royce, he used to drive us to school in it every day and I was just mortified. We used to beg him to just drop us at the end of the road. He had a van for work and we used to beg him to take us in the van. How times have changed because I would love to ride in a Rolls-Royce today."
5. Her first atelier was the school bathroom: "I''ve always loved fashion. At school, I used to do a little bit of customizing the school uniform in the toilets at lunchtime." 
6. Her first date was at McDonald''s:"He was the first boy to ask me out at school because I really wasn’t popular with the boys. They weren’t interested in me."
7. Her first big fashion purchase: "I bought Patrick Cox shoes when I got my first paycheck from the Spice Girls. They were white slingback Wannabes. I queued up outside Patrick Cox on a Saturday afternoon with my sister."
8. Her backup plan (in case the pop stardom/fashion icon thing didn''t work out): I  qualified to be a dance teacher...because my mom always taught me if I had to have something to fall back on, I could have that. So if this doesn’t go well, I can be a tap-dancing teacher."
9. The original name for the Spice Girls: "We were going to be the Spicy Girls, but thenthere was a porn site called the Spicy Girls. So we had to change it, because obviously that wouldn’t have been very good."
10. The Spice Girls'' message:  "We were five girls that individually weren’t that great, but collectively we worked together and normal girls could relate to us. The message was that it’s OK to be different. That’s where girl power came from. Be who you are, be proud to be who you are, and really value friendships." 
11. How the girls snuck away from their first managers:  "We escaped in the middle of the night from the house we were in. We had a demo CD that we recorded [that] Geri hid it in her knickers. We just decided to leave one night and we decided to do things differently. We did our research. We were very impressed with Annie Lennox’s career, so we found [her manager] Simon Fuller. Now he’s my friend and my partner in the [fashion] business. I''ve known Simon since I was 18 years old."
12. On meeting husband David: "Simon was a huge Manchester United fan. He introduced me and David after the gameWhat I really liked about David right from the start is that when all the other players were in the lounge afterward having a drink with their friends, David was sitting with his mom and dad and his younger sister. I really liked that. I’m really close to my family, he’s very close to his and I just  thought that was really nice."
13. How he proposed: "We were in a hotel up north and he got down on one knee and he proposed. He asked my dad before he did that, which was great and very appropriate."
14. On being pregnant with Brooklyn on tour:  "We were on tour in America and performing in lots of amphitheaters...I remember it was really, really, really hot. I was wearing a PVC catsuit and a wig, because my hair was just out of control because it was so hot! I had such terrible morning sickness. And Melanie B too, because she was pregnant at the same time. It was awful, absolutely awful. And then I got bigger and bigger and bigger and I was still wearing that PVC catsuit and platform trainers.  It was quite tough being on tour and being pregnant at the same time. I’d come off stage and I’d say to the tour manager, I can’t go on. What happens if I just say ''I’m going home and I don’t want to do this anymore''? Every night he would say, ''you’ll get sued, get the catsuit back on.''" 
15. On walking the Roberto Cavalli runway:  "I remember phoning my mom and saying ''I’m really nervous. I’m walking in this fashion show.'' She said to me:  ''You’ve been walking for 30 years; if you haven’t been able to get it by now, well.''"
16. On launching her first ready-to-wear collection: "We had two models, no stylists. I didn’t know about that. The two girls would just walk toward us and I started talking, because I love talking. People started to like the fact that I narrated through the collections. Sometimes it would be me and a roomful of people and sometimes it would be me and just one person. And even if that person didn’t speak English, I would talk about the collection. Because I just loved it."
17. On fear:  "Sometimes, I really think and I really wish I could sit back and enjoy the moment more, but I''m terrified. It''s not that I want to prove anything to anyone other than myself, but there are lots of things I want to do. And it’s nerve-racking and it doesn’t get any easier. I asked Marc Jacobs, ''does it get any easier? Am I going to feel like this every season?'' And he said ''yeah.''"
18. Who she wants to dress next: "Hillary Clinton...I would love to dress her."
19. On designing an affordable collection: "I’d like to offer clothes to people that can’t or don’t want to pay designer prices. I really want to make women feel great and be empowered. I still want to reach out to that customer.  It’s just figuring out who to do it with and when to do it."
20. What she says when she sees someone wearing her designs: "When I see a person wearing my dress or carrying of of my handbags, that’s really exciting to me. I always say ''you looks great'' and you can see that women feel good and they feel sexy in the dresses."
21. Her kids'' take on Spice World: "I’ve watched it with them. They laugh. It’s  actually funny. One of them is obsessed with the Spice bus."

If you''re a proud member of the Tall Girl Club, your list of most pressing fashion gripes probably reads something like this: Long sleeves on the hanger turn into 3/4-length sleeves on your arms, knee-length hemlines can wind up being downright mini, maxi dresses are never quite maxi enough, and what''s supposed to be cropped—pants, culottes, or even a top—never winds up looking quite right. If any of that sounds familiar, help is on the way—thanks to model-slash-tall-person Karlie Kloss. 

The supermodel was snapped on her way into Taylor Swift''s apartment this week wearing an adorable off-the-shoulder crop top from the latest TTYA x Long Tall Sally capsule collection. Ringing in at $49, this crop top, along with the rest of the collection, is specifically designed for women who are 5''8" and taller, offering up pieces that are proportioned for those with longer limbs. 
Long Tall Sally''s collaboration with British designer label Taller Than Your Average, first launched back in October and returns this season with a ton of summer must-haves.

According to bathing suit expert Kirsten Sarkisian, you never put on a bikini top only once. "First, you put it on—simply put it on your body," the founder of Belusso swimwear tells Glamour, "but do not assume it''s ready to go at this point."
Here''s why a perfect-fitting suit can require a little bit of adjusting—and three easy steps to making sure everything is shimmied into place.
 
A Belusso bikini
Per Sarkisian, getting the perfect fit can be broken down into three quick steps.
1. Right away, handle the straps, making them tighter or looser so that they feel secure but aren''t digging into your skin.
2. Then, manually arrange your breasts by picking them up and pulling them gently toward the center of your torso—they should be fully enclosed by the structure of the bikini top.
3. Finish by checking yourself in a mirror to see if the top is riding up too high in the back or on the sides and make slight coordinating adjustments to the straps.
If you find you''re rarely pleased with how your curves look in a bikini, there could be a sneaky suspect to blame.
"Padding can sag when it gets wet and takes longer to dry than the rest of the suit," Sarkisian said. "A suit with a little bit of it can be a good call for women with smaller breasts, but beware. Look for suits with removable pads so you can pull it out if need be."

For the last eight years, the Kate Spade New York the world has known has had little to do with the woman actually named Kate Spade. Rather, Spade, who started her namesake brand in 1993, and her husband, Andy, who also worked for the brand, bowed out when the company was purchased in late 2006.

The original Kate Spade is now set to rejoin the world of fashion designers, with plans to release a full line of shoes and assorted bags in time for this holiday season.
"I''ve spent the last eight years raising my daughter and being a consumer. It''s exciting to be back at work," she told WWD. There are no further details at the moment, including a brand name or prices, but legal restrictions mean Spade will not be able to use her own name.

The world''s going crazy for Dong Lei, a model who was on Chinese reality show Supermodel and has legs that clock in at 45 inches—a.k.a. the approximate size of a seven-year-old girl. In China, the average height for a woman is 5''3" (63 inches), meaning Lei''s legs would be over 70 percent of their total stature. In the U.S., the typical female is 65 inches.
To put those super stems in perspective, we present the below:

Prepare to rethink what splurging on accessories can really mean. The most expensive bag to sell at auction hit the chopping block at Christie''s last week, going for $221,844 at an auction in Hong Kong. It was a pink crocodile Hermès Birkin studded with diamonds—and it was sold to an unnamed bidder over the phone.

 The idea of a handbag bringing in big money is nothing new. Before last week''s sale, here were the top sells—believe it or not six of the seven most expensive handbags ever sold at auction were Birkins.
Not a Birkin for $218,500 in 2011: A diamond and gold style previously owned by Elizabeth Taylor takes the honor as the only non Birkin to make the list. The details reported by WSJ are scant, but a flick through the 2011 auction catalog that previewed her jewelry (the section where the high-rolling bag was included) show both a golden clutch and a Fred Leighton elephant bag that was gifted to Taylor from Michael Jackson as a birthday present. 
Birkin for $203,150 in 2015: Before Monday''s record-setting sale, this was the most expensive Birkin to sell at auction.  
Birkin for $185,000 in 2014: Last fall the below Birkin, made of Himalayan Nilo Crocodile and including a total of 9.84 carats of diamonds, sold in Beverly Hills.

Birkin for $113,525 in 2011: A blue croc Birkin went at the same Dallas auction the the previous record-setter did.
Birkin for $95,000 in 2011: Also in Dallas: a red croc Birkin.
Birkin for $80,663 in 2011: A third Hermès Birkin made bank at the same Dallas sale.
In case you''re curious, the world''s most expensive handbag is thought to be Mouawad''s "1001 Nights" purse. The 18-carat-gold bag has 4,517 yellow, pink, and colorless diamonds, combining for an impressive 381.92 carats, and has been estimated at $3.8 million.

With the recent runaway success of its I''m No Angel campaign, Lane Bryant has the fashion industry buzzing. And the plus-size retailer is hoping to keep that momentum going through next year, with today''s announcement that Christian Siriano will become its newest guest designer.
The Project Runway alum, known for his curve-hugging red carpet gowns, will launch a capsule collection for the specialty retailer, which will bow in spring 2016. Siriano joins the ranks of Bryant''s former designer collaborators such as Isabel Toledo, Sophie Theallet, and Lela Rose.
  "Fashion should never be defined by size," Siriano said in a statement about the collection, which will range in size from 14 to 28. "Regardless if it’s for red carpet or a day at the office, every woman should feel stylish and comfortable in their clothes. I’m excited about this partnership with Lane Bryant because it allows me the opportunity to showcase my designs on the everyday woman and allow them the opportunity to feel as beautiful and fashionable as possible.”

A shopping addiction doesn''t have to be wallet-crippling—so long as you''re working it right and avoiding paying full price whenever possible. Immediate gratification—that gotta-have-that-now rush—is behind a lot of retail action, but if you''re patient enough, you just might reap the reward of crazy deals. Top shoppers know that scoring big is about a combination of waiting for sales, considering roundabout buying options, and stealthily stalking your target.

Secret 1: Price Compare. It sounds obvious, but too many people commit to buying without investigating whether the same item is available elsewhere for less. Do it yourself by cross-checking the item at various online department stores or let tech do the legwork. Shopstyle is revered within shopping circles for the way it brings up multiple places an item is listed for sale—including the one that''s slashed by 30 percent.
Secret 2: Don''t Write Off Resale. Consignment and resale sites and apps are having a major moment, all to the benefit of shoppers who now have a multitude of places to shop for preowned pieces that have been vetted by teams of professionals for authenticity and condition. 
Secret 3: Be Patient. If you''ve had your eye on a pair of shoes or bag that are classics available season after season, wait out that lusty, must-buy-now moment until any of the year''s dependable sales roll around (the same goes for general items without brand specifics you''re craving, like a pair of leather leggings or a black cashmere crewneck). Department stores typically run a big percentage-off-everything sale every quarter or so; when you see that publicized, get ready to shop.
Secret 4: Practice Your eBay Skills.For buying or selling, eBay is a gold mine of opportunities (we broke it all down to help you get over any apprehensions). Along with pre-loved items, plenty of listings flash the Holy Grail of NWT—new with tags—meaning you can find the same stuff from store shelves at a way-reduced price.
Secret 5: Check Coupons. Coupon-clipping isn''t just for discount-happy types on reality shows: The bargain-hunting tactic is alive and well. Before you buy from any online site, do a quick Internet search with the store''s name and "coupon." You''ll likely be directed to results from Retail Me Not or Coupons.com. The sites have duds but also plenty of money-saving working codes you otherwise would''ve totally miss out on.
Secret 6: Beef Up Your Shopping Tool Belt. Online shopping is a marvelous thing, with new technologically minded shopping aids popping up all the time. Familiarize yourself with them. Apps like Keep track items you want and ping you when the product goes on sale; Shopbop''s heart function catalogs everything you''ve admired, making it beyond easy to browse your favorites and check what''s been reduced.
Secret 7: ABS: Always Be Shopping. The quickest way to not get a deal is to realize you want something and immediately go out and get it. Instead, pro shoppers keep a mental list of things they''re hunting for and keep their eyes open, always. Make it a habit to cruise around the sale sections of any dot-coms or brick-and-mortars you visit because, truly, you never know what gems will be hiding.

The silk pajama set Grace Coddington wore to the Met Gala this year got almost as much press as Beyonce’s sheer Givenchy dress or Rihanna’s elaborate Guo Pei yellow robe. And for good reason. The Vogue creative director''s unexpected fashion maneuver that night was a bold statement about nonconformism, the parameters of formal dress code, personal agency, luxury, and fashion as artistic expression. She also proved to the world that everyone needs a pair of fancy pajamas in their life—stat.

Though Coddington''s set is meant for evening hours, there''s no reason the tailored look shouldn''t see light of day from time to time. Here are six compelling reasons you need fancy jammies in your life, immediately.
 
We Wore What blogger Danielle Bernstein rocks the trend with denim cutoffs
1. Look chic without even trying. As evidenced above, a silk pajama top and jean shorts is the perfect summer weekend look—and roll-out-bed-throw-on-pants easy.
2. Pajamas are iconic—in a serious fashion-cred way. Who doesn’t want to feel three parts Audrey Hepburn (think Breakfast at Tiffany''s, Charade, and Roman Holiday) and equal parts Coco Chanel (the style was a favorite of Chanel''s—and she even produced couture pajamas for her best clients).
3. Wake up in the morning and you''re already halfway there. You will never again struggle getting dressed in the morning. Not sure what to wear when you emerge from your featherbed in fancy pajamas? You’re already (at least half) dressed!
4. Versatility, thy name is pajama. If you are, indeed, going to sport the look outside your home, the styling options are endless. Pair the top with everything from a pencil skirt to denim shorts, or throw on a classic cashmere sweater or tuck in a T-shirt with the luxe bottoms.
5. Men have been doing it for ages. This is a classic borrowed-from-the-boys moment: Guys learned the ways of the fancy pajama set long before we did (see: Hugh Hefner, noted pajama lover), and it’s time to try it out for yourself.
6. They''re the perfect summer house look. Lest we forget the summer plans we’ve made that involve tons of communal PJ time! Trade in your boxers and T-shirt mix for something a little more share-house-friendly.

For as long as we can remember Barbie''s perpetually been stuck in a tippy-toe stance, ready to slip into heels and...well, stand around. With the unveiling of a brand-new range of dolls, Barbie has finally gotten articulated ankles—joints that actually move, allowing her the option to switch between heels and flats.

The big news here isn''t that Barbie''s in flats—it''s that she (via the army of youngsters who play with her) gets to choose what sort of footwear she/they are feeling on any given day. Other dolls feature feet in a perma-flat position (like this and this), but the style pictured above has been crafted with ankle joints so that two pairs of shoes, ankle boots and flats, both work.  
Taking Barbie out of a stiletto-only environment certainly registers as a sort of feminist fashion win, but this multi-choice option is actually even bigger. Flats OR pumps? It''s the lady''s right to choose.

During her first pregnancy with North, Kim Kardashian made it very apparent that a baby bump was not going to slow her fashion train. She wore heels, high-waisted pants, and a Givenchy gown that the Internet went meme-crazy for. But with baby No. 2 on the way now, she''s got a new game plan.

"I''m going to be more simple. I don''t care if I wear the same thing as long as it fits and it''s comfortable," she told Hollywood Life. If the pink curve-hugging latex number she picked yesterday looks familiar, it''s because we''ve seen her in similar styles before—two to be exact. "This outfit is actually really comfortable. It was hanging in my closet, and I was like, ''Do I wear this now because it still fits me and I can''t wear it much longer?''"
Due to the similarities the new dress shares with Kim''s earlier looks, it was probably delivered at the same time from designer Atsuko Kudo. If she hadn''t gotten around to wearing this sleeveless style yet, she''s certainly right to trot it out now before her pregnancy gets more advanced.
Kim said she''s working with a nutritionist this time to eat better than she did with North and wants to avoid the water-weight gain she experienced.
"At the end of the day, I''m trying to live in the moment and really enjoy the pregnancy. I''m gonna get bigger, that''s OK. I will figure out how to dress."

Neiman Marcus, Macy''s, Nordstrom, and Cole Haan are all on board for the launch later this month, which will begin with iPhone and iPad platforms. Android-optimized Buyable Pins will come shortly thereafter. 
According to Mashable, there will be more than 2 million products available to purchase on the social network at launch, and the Buyable Pins will be identifiable in your feed thanks to a little blue price tag.

Looking for a way to turn your social media habits into actionable shopping advice? Well, Old Navy is now offering one idea in the form of emoodji.com, a site that not only tells you which emojis you use the most but also recommends the perfect flip-flop and beach vacation based on that data.

Here''s how it works: Enter your Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook handle, and the site instantly calculates your most-used emoji. Cool, right?
The site then guesses your mood based on that particularly emoji—say, the dancing woman in a red dress or the one with hearts for eyes—takes you to a mood board of results, made up of the perfect flip-flop color and beach vacation. (If you share the board, you''re also entered for a chance to win the dream getaway.)
Even if you don''t win, the fun doesn''t stop with knowing what emoji you use most—you can enter anyone''s social handles—from your friends to, say, Beyonce—to see what they use most as well! 

In an exclusive survey, Old Navy unearthed a slew of interesting data around emojis: the top-used emojis, for example, are the tongue sticking out, crying faces, thumbs-up, heart eyes (a personal favorite) and, unsurprisingly, poop. Forty-six percent of millennials apparently use emojis daily and 28 percent of emoji users feel it’s very important to have a taco emoji (we concur). 
When asked to describe themselves as an emoji, 22 percent of people said they would use the cool-glasses emoji, 27 percent would describe themselves as the emoji with its tongue sticking out, and—get this—only 7 percent describe themselves as the dancing lady in a red dress.

To all the women who earn their paychecks in corporate offices where matching separates are the norm: Dressing for work doesn''t have to be a boring exercise of taking plain item A and mixing it with basic piece B. 
"When it comes to great work wear, it''s all about subtle details that break from the norm ever so slightly," Miyako Nakamura, cofounder and creative director of MM.LaFleur, told Glamour.
"Mix up colors and fabrics to keep your look from feeling cookie-cutter corporate," cofounder and CEO Sarah LaFleur added. "Even in very formal offices, you can play without looking out of place as long as you choose pieces that are beautifully constructed."
 
MM. LaFleur shirt, $110, and blazer, $195 
1. Play with proportion. The standard suit is pretty easy to sketch in your mind: a classic blazer with straight-leg trousers or a pencil skirt that hits right at the knee. Shaking things up makes everything more interesting while still staying within the safe harbors of accepted office style. Amanda Kraemer, style director at Loft, suggested wearing a cropped jacket over a dress or reversing the equation by pairing a relaxed-fit jacket with a slim, mid-calf skirt.
2. Look for little differences. Some of the strongest ways to add a dose of style are actually the littlest tweaks, according to Nakamura. She suggested trying bracelet-length or wide sleeves, high-waisted bottoms, and center seams that run down the front of dresses and blouses. "Longer skirts aren''t typical office attire, but you can pull them off, especially on a summer Friday. Try pairing one with a high-necked blouse or a super-tailored blazer."
3. Keep an eye out for familiar pieces with modern silhouettes. "I love the idea of choosing classic pieces that have an easy, modern cut, like a dress with a dropped shoulder or a tailored skirt that hits at midcalf, not at the knee," LaFleur said. Take a sheath dress, that professional style building block, and then let designers color outside the box just a bit, whether that means a cowl neck or layered cap sleeves.
4. Prints are totally fine. You aren''t destined to a solid-color closet, but there are some Dos and Don''ts of introducing pattern. "Leave the wild florals at home and opt for prints that are small, graphic, and repeat in an organized way," Nakamura said. 
 
Loft high-waisted skirt, $60
5. Add an extra layer. If work requires a jacket, don''t stress about figuring out ways to ditch it—make it part of a bigger style statement. "I love the look of adding a longer boyfriend cardigan under a more serious structured blazer," Kraemer told us, pointing out that the additional layer comes in handy when office managers get overzealous with the air conditioner in the summer months.
6. Consider "slightly-off" colors. All the experts we spoke to insisted that you can go beyond black and navy, although staying in the neutral family is wise. "There''s a huge spectrum that looks both beautiful and polished," Nakamura mused, listing plum, burgundy, olive, and emerald as personal favorites. "Even within those shades there''s so much nuance. Instead of a true gray, I love a lilac-gray or a bluish slate. Slightly ''off'' shades feel free fresh without being out of bounds."
7. Make your own suiting. "Don''t be afraid to wear a non-suit as a suit!" Kraemer insisted. Her guidelines for crafting your own look are to pick complementary colors that are still clearly different (i.e., avoid a navy jacket with a skirt that''s a slightly different dark blue hue) and mix fabrics. "Try a textured jacket with a floaty skirt."
8. Finish with playful flats. Many corporate spots will let you slide with shoes that are spunkier than basic pumps. Embrace it, but heed suggestions that brights or prints work better as flats, not heels, and shop for pointy-toe styles in a stripe or bold color.
9. Experiment with monochrome looks. Nakamura shared her favorite stylish office look with us: going monochrome. "It creates a sense of fluidity that can make you look taller and is so much more interesting than the traditional white-shirt-black-skirt look." 
10. Embrace a powerful accessory. "Accessories are always a safe bet that can add instant interest to an outfit while still maintaining professional style," Kraemer said. It''s an easy spot to show personality or a knowledge of trends: Add on bright earrings or a necklace in a favorite color (or Marsala, the official shade for 2015).
As you start injecting some style into your work wardrobe, know there are a few cardinal rules not to be broken in a conservative field. "Stay away from deep V-necks, stick with a jacket or a blazer, and if you experiment with color, make sure that the overall look is still grounded in a neutral," Kraemer told Glamour.

	Cereals, vegetables and pulses: as well as those foods notoriously rich in fibre (whether soluble or insoluble) there are many others that can help us get our ideal daily dose of fibre. First of all, it must be said that those following a traditional Mediterranean diet can rest assured: two portions of vegetables and fruit every day facilitate a natural fibre intake. Cereals do the rest.

	But if we were short of time, as often happens, and wished to absorb as much fibre as possible in the form of snacks or a packed lunch, which foods could be introduced (surprisingly) to our diet?

	The following list of foods rich in fibre sets out to provide an indicative and by no means exhaustive answer, to point you fearlessly in the direction of a fibre-integrated diet. 

RASPBERRIES


	Containing plenty of vitamin C, water and folic acid, they act as antioxidants but, above all, are rich in fibre. You could take some to work as a mid-morning snack – without any added sugar of course. One cup of raspberries contains on average 8 grams of fibre and very few calories (about 70).

CHIA SEEDS



	Seeds in general, and chia seeds in particular, are a nutritional godsend. You can add them to the salad you eat in the office at lunchtime or start to use them in creamed vegetable soups. Fresh chia can also be consumed as a drink.

CHESTNUTS

 Are you out shopping and in need of a healthy, fibre-rich snack? Buy some hot chestnuts from the nearest stall and you will be sure to get the daily dose of fibre you need to keep fit. They also supply energy and rebalance your intestinal micro flora.

MUSHROOMS

 We often forget the fact that mushrooms also contain plenty of fibre: 100 grams of mushrooms, for example, contain much more fibre than a slice of wholemeal bread. Amazing, isn’t it?

AVOCADO

 We will never tire of saying it: avocado is a super food and apart from all the vitamins, its ability to keep cholesterol at bay and its versatility in the kitchen, it is also rich in fibre. Start to add this fruit to your salads and you will not regret it. Foto: ©Flickr/Jaanus Silla

BULGUR, AMARANTH SEEDS AND QUINOA 

Three foods that have only recently become part of our everyday diet, but which are nevertheless rich in fibre. Bulgur (the processed groats of different types of germinated wheat grain, comprising durum wheat) can provide you with up to 6 grams of fibre. Instead, Amaranth and Quinoa are not actually grains but seeds, seeds that behave like cereals: both have around 5 grams of fibre per portion.

ALMONDS

 Generally speaking, all kinds of dried fruit contain a fair amount of fibre but none of them beat almonds: 30 grams of almonds contain 4 grams of fibre. An excellent snack which, along with fibre, also supplies the body with lots of proteins.   Foto: ©Flickr/HealthAliciousNess

	The latest episode of Culinary Journeys show is set to air this evening at 1630 BST and 2330 BST on CNN International, following the award winning Indian chef Gaggan Anand as he takes a journey back to his his home city of Kolkata.

	Anand runs the Gaggan restaurant in Bangkok which was this year voted number one on Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants list. He’s known for taking the street food of his home country, giving it a truly hearty kick and mixing up age old recipes with modern techniques and styles.

	In the episode he travel back to Kolkata in India to speak with the street food sellers that have inspired his cuisine and try to unearth the cooking secrets they protect and pass on through generations.



	We caught up with the chef just after his trip to find out more about it and ask him about some of the highlights of his own career journey.

Tell us about the episode, how was it for you?
	I chose my city of Kolkata where I come from, it was a very easy choice, then to cook something from there and go to the archive of what happens there…For me Kolkata is my memory, my nostalgic city, when I get down from the airport the first thing I do is go to a sweet shop and buy these sweets that remind me of back home.

What did you learn from this episode? 
I learned a lot about Bengal cooking and the use of mustard, I always thought this was a British influence but actually cooking with mustard is really a Bengali approach and this was interesting.

	When I was cooking back home I never got that famous and I would go and ask people who I knew how to cook really good food in Kolkata they would never teach me, they would never expose their secrets of dishes in the kitchen but now through CNN and the fame that I have, I have actually got access to the treasure of secret recipes they have. It;s a learning experience for me because in India food is very domesticated, they don’t want to share how it is cooked but just appreciate how it is tastes.

How was your first journey home after winning Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants? 
	Within three days I went back home, it was like going back and meeting my mum and they were very very happy and then actually I went to a famous restaurant and everybody there said hi to me and it was a little struggle to accept the fame but the funniest thing was that on the way back I was sitting on the airline and this lady said “are you Gaggan Anand” - I said yes and she said, “I’ve been trying to get a reservation for three weeks”.

If I gave you a blank cheque, what’s the culinary journey you would love to take? 
	It would be Japan for sure and it would really need a blank cheque, I go almost three times a year to Japan and every time I discover something new. I like Japan for the respect and the way they protect things - there are melons that cost $1,000 and $5,000 for a strawberry, I really do need a blank cheque for sure and I would be like a little kid in my Willy Wonka world. The thing with Japan is that even an egg sandwich inside a Seven Eleven tastes really good, I’ve never had a bad meal in Japan, I wish I was born there.

	The show will play again on CNN International at the times below and we''ll be bringing you clips from the epsiode on Monday.

	Who wants a boring marriage? The one between milk & coffee for instance, the same old routine every morning: hot coffee mixed with cold milk, cold coffee mixed with warm milk, lukewarm latte, boiling hot coffee with lukewarm milk, latte heated up in the microwave. Come on, we have to make more of an effort for the most important meal of the day, starting from what we drink: let’s start thinking in terms of creative breakfast ideas. 

	1) The first couple we reommend is a union between vanilla-aromatized black Ceylon tea and milk. To fully appreciate its sweet aromatized accents, add a drop of milk instead of sugar for a beverage you will be dying to dunk your breakfast rusks into. Highly recommended for those who like their morning cuppa to brim with warm sensations.

	2) If you are vegans, or simply not fond of cow’s milk, try the interesting couple: almond milk and coffee. Having risen to fame for its cold coffee sweetened by the precious nectar, this summer affair can live through the winter on the strength of a nice hot coffee with plenty of body. Dedicated to the more romantic, those who need a touch of reassurance early in the morning.

	3) A marriage well worth a try, especially on those mornings when you are not quite so rushed, is the one between fruit juice (or smoothie) and natural soy yogurt. The result is a breakfast dish packed with vitamins and mineral salts, neither too liquid nor too sweet, whose soft consistency makes it a real energy-boosting treat, perfect for facing even a cold rainy day. Ideal for those seeking healthy nourishment.

	4) For a pleasant lazy weekend or a Monday morning that needs to be started on the right foot, what could be better than the most ravishing couple in the world: hot chocolate and cream. A vegan (and healthy) alternative: use the cream obtained from coconut milk rather than cow’s milk, and use water to make up the hot chocolate instead of milk.

	5) The last breakfast couple to try – or rediscover – is that of ginger and honey. A healthy partnership that will give you an extra boost when you happen to be feeling a bit poorly or out of sorts. A ginger root brew aromatized with a spoonful of Italian honey will help you feel better and keep you warm throughout the morning. For those in need of curative pampering.

 (76,'Food','https://www.finedininglovers.com/stories/new-food-domains/','New Foodie Domains: a Recipe for Success?


	They call them the new domains for foodies: domain names, a website''s extension in letters, dedicated entirely to food and wine enthusiasts. Food bloggers, restaurateurs, owners of bars and bistros, or maybe those who are passionate about coffee, wine and organic products, even skilled and attentive producers or pizza makers. For a few months now, they''ve had new suffixes available to them, with the most popular and in demand are those ending in .Coffee, .Kitchen, .Pizza, .Recipes, .Restaurant, .Catering, .Wine, .Beer, .Menu and .Organic.

	Soon, however, more will come from the generic .Food (not yet available), with a single and important purpose: to recognize a professional on the internet at first glance, or a site run by experts in the food and wine sectors. The question is legitimate: were the old .com and .net not enough? No. Or rather, not anymore, because consistency is demanded from the restaurateur as concerns that presented on the menu and the food served on the plate. Equally transparent information is requested on the net: users search information, a suggestion - and already create an opinion based on the site''s name. This is valid in the fashion and luxury sectors, and even more so in the food and wine sector where quality and reliability are key and intrinsic features of the service.

	On the web, a website is equivalent to a business card, or the sign over the store. As such, more and more attention is paid to a site''s web address. In this context, since 2013, ICANN, the international body tasked to coordinate the management of certain internet services, has decided to release a number of new extensions such as the large family of .Kitchen and the like. Among the reasons, there is also one linked to the short supply of .com domains, as well as a technical trick: to be found in the search engines, particularly Google, the rule is to offer a higher keyword density, and having a keyword related to your industry that is already in the site''s extension is a way to gain further hits.

	Technicalities aside, the sectorial domain name has already become an important piece of technology. In Italy, one of the most important wine consortia that has international visibility, Prosecco, has just decided to register a .Bio domain (the Italian translation of "organic") to protect its brand and strengthen the link between the product and the unique concept of organic production. Many other large companies are following, each in its own field. Another case in point is the domain .Pizza, which despite having a very Italian name and soul, "Neapolitan pizza", lends itself to being rather widespread throughout the world, and due to the international nature of this dish, to be used outside of Italy''s borders. Although it is still early to understand what the future holds for these domains, their debut has been very positive and transversal: they have already been chosen by small local neighborhood restaurants as well as large ones, cooking schools and caterers, street food vendors and food producers. In Italy, where the subject of food is now in the spotlight thanks to Expo Milano 2015, the .bio domain became the fourth TLD (Top Level Domain) in 2015, the most sold in the span of just a few months (after .com, .net and .it). In France, the and the .vin and .wine domains have become the symbol of authenticity and uniqueness of the nectar of the gods - wine - and fight against forgery.

The Future Food District at Expo Milano 2015, an entire experience that offers people the chance to experience food shopping in the future, is now in full swing and the pictures from inside the space are impressive.

	Designed by the Italian architect and Carlo Ratti - the space offers people a glimpse of exactly what a supermarket in the future may look like, a chance to see a vertical farm and also a range of cool refreshment kiosks.

	We spoke with Ratti before the space opened but now we can reveal exactly what a trip to the supermarket of the future entails.



	Guests start by taking lightweight and recyclable baskets that are made out of cardboard. Once inside the one of five shopping areas they can then place products on interactive tables that reveal information about the product such as ‘presence of allergens, geographic origins, nutritional values and environmental impact’.

	All food is packed in future style packaging using high pressure and is designed to keep foods fresh for longer, reducing overall waste.



	This really is your chance to step into the future and experience food, shopping and information delivery in a whole new way.

	Teff is destined to be one of the protagonists of 2015, or so reports on the new year’s foodie trends would have us believe. Following the boom of quinoa, the non-cereal we see more and more often on the tables of the western world, in 2015 we shall probably be learning to cook and enjoy teff, the gluten free cereal from Eritrea and Ethiopia, grown in North-West Africa and South-West Arabia. But are you sure to know what is teff? It is a fortunate period for this ancient cereal, particularly now that food tolerance has become such an issue. An ancient cereal indeed since it was cultivated as long ago as 2000 B.C.

	Teff is officially recognized as being a super food, one of those foods everyone should eat regularly. What’s so special about it? The fact that it is naturally gluten free like quinoa: this makes it a versatile basic ingredient for oven-baked dishes and pasta. But let’s not forget its other qualities: Teff contains great quantities of calcium, iron and amino acids, as well as being rich in protein.

	Both are excellent substitutes for more traditional cereals; both have a lower carbohydrate content than other cereals (teff: 65 g per 100 g; quinoa: 64 g per 100 g) and are protein-rich (teff: 12 g; quinoa: 14 g). Even from the more banal viewpoint of calories, the two cereals are very similar (approximately 400 calorie per 100 g). Teff is only superior to Quinoa with regard to its content of calcium and iron: 100 g of teff contains around 180 mg of calcium and 7.63 mg of iron; in 100 g of quinoa these values are considerably lower, "only" 47 mg of calcium and 4.75 mg of iron.

	Teff is mainly used as a flour in Eritrean and Somali cooking; above all, it is widely used for making a spongy type of bread called Injera, particularly familiar to the clients of Eritrean and Ethiopian restaurants. Injera starts out as a dough that is almost creamy in consistency, made from flour and water, which is poured onto a hot griddle just like a crepe. Unlike quinoa, it is not a cereal that lends itself very well to preparing first course dishes, that is to say, cooked in the same way as rice or pasta. Its particles are really tiny so it is perfect as a flour for making bread, pasta and oven-baked products. In other words, it makes an excellent substitute in all those dishes in which traditional white flour is used.

	There is a high demand for Teff in Ethiopia and Eritrea and, in recent years, western markets have also started to appreciate the versatility of this cereal. At present, the greatest European exporter of Teff is Spain. In some countries, it may not be easy to come by in mainstream supermarkets but it is sold in organic food stores or online. On average it costs around 5 Euros a kilo.

Soft, ring-shaped lemon sponge is a traditional Italian cake that is both simple and versatile. Ideal for breakfast, this sponge is a welcome treat at any time of the day: as an afternoon snack with a pot of tea or as a dessert at the end of a meal served with confectioner’s custard or a fruit purée.

	But what happens if we attempt to make a lighter version of a ring-shaped cake, without the use of a raising agent? 4 simple steps will enable you to prepare a yeast free lemon sponge without any chemical baking powder, as delicious as any you have ever tasted.

Click here to get the complete recipe of our ring-shaped yeast free sponge cake

1. Chemical baking powder can be replaced by using baking soda, a basic ingredient, together with lemon juice, which provides the acidic component of the raising process.

2. Once baked, leave the cake in the switched off oven for about 2 minutes. When you have taken it out of the oven, it is necessary to leave it to rest for 10 minutes at room temperature. This simple step will prevent the ring from breaking up when you take it out of the cake tin.

3. The use of organic lemons will result in a more assertively flavoured cake with a much more intense aroma.

4. One of the salient characteristics of this cake is its soft texture, which depends on the fact that the egg whites are beaten to soft snowy peaks before being added to the mixture.

Margot Janse is the chef at the award winning Tasting Room restaurant inside the wonderful Relais and Châteaux Le Quartier Français Hotel in Franschhoek, South Africa.

	Her restaurant has been named the best in South Africa on a number of different occasions and sits at number 88 on the World’s 50 Best Restaurants 51-100 list.

	The chef, who trained as an actress, is from the Netherlands and originally moved to South Africa to follow her passion for photography before switching it up and heading in a culinary direction.

	Fresh, seasonal and always balanced, much of the ingredients she presents come directly from the restaurant’s onsite garden. An ambassador of the diverse indigenous ingredients that surround her, Janse has become one of the most exciting chefs in the world right now.

	She’s also taking time out of her busy schedule to join the jury for the Grand Final of S.Pellegrino Young Chef 2015 which takes place at the end of this month in Milan.

	We caught up with the chef to find out more about this role and get some of her advice for the young chefs of the future.

Tell us your best piece of advice for young chefs? 
	To work with open ears and eyes. To absorb like a sponge and question everything. To understand that the journey of becoming a good chef is neither quick nor easy.

Tell us about a time when you remember making a mistake as a young chef? What happened, where were you working and what did you learn? 
	I was presented with bunches of spinach and pretended to know what Chiffonade meant, which obviously did not work out so well in the end. Always ask. No question is ever stupid.

What’s the best advice anyone has ever given to you? 
	Taste it in your head before you start.

What’s the worst mistake a young chef can make? 
	To think they know it all once they leave culinary college.

What do you think about the idea to pairing young chefs with young designers? 
	Fabulous as there is a strong element of design in food too and it will be very interesting to see the inspiration/collaboration.

Why in your opinion is S.Pellegrino Young Chef important? 
	It is a brilliant platform for younger chefs to get exposure on many levels. To enter the international arena and work alongside similar chefs from many different countries and cultures.

If you could be a young chef again, what would you do differently? 
	I have been pretty lucky with the way my career path took shape, but I don''t think one can ever travel too much.

What are some of the most exciting developing in the South African food scene at the moment? 
	The whole South African food scene is super exciting. The celebration of Africa through its indigenous and also many endemic products is very strong. We have an amazing story to tell and many chefs are proudly doing so in their very own culinary language.

What are some of the most exciting things you’re currently working on in the kitchen? 
	We are constantly evolving, are expanding our own vegetable and herb garden. We have hosted 2 guest Chefs in the past year and are exploring the option of doing this more often.

Tell us about some of the other projects you’re working on for 2015? New books, restaurants, shows? 
	This year is my 20th year as Chef at Le Quartier Francais. I am working on  ''the'' book and we are planning some celebrations for my anniversary later this year. I will be joining 9 other international female chefs  to India in September in aid of a Charity. It is a very exciting project.

The Learn to Code movement has picked up momentum worldwide and that is actually a good thing as even basic programming skills can have a major impact. If you can teach yourself how to write code, you gain a competitive edge over your peers, you can think more algorithmically and thus can tackle problems more efficiently.
 

Don’t just download the latest app, help redesign it. Don’t just play on your phone, program it. — Obama.
There’s no reason why shouldn’t know the basics of coding. You can automate tasks, you can program your Excel sheets, improve workflows, you can extract data from websites and accomplish so much more with code. You may not be in the business of writing software programs but knowing the basics of coding will help you communicate more effectively with developers.
Gone are the days when you had to enroll in expensive computer training classes as now exist a plethora of web-based courses that will help you learn programming at your own pace in the comfort of your web browser.
If you are ready to take the plunge, here are some of the best websites that offer courses in a variety of programming languages for free. I have also added a list of companion ebooks that will give you a more in-depth understanding of the language and they don’t cost anything either.
If there are kids in the family, you should download either Tynker (Android/iOS) or the Hopscotch app for iPad and they can learn the basics of programming through games and puzzles.
There’s also Scratch, an MIT project that allows kids to program their own stories and games visually.

How do you make international calls from your mobile phone? Mobile carriers often charge exorbitant rates for international phone calls but you can Internet based services like Skype or Google Hangouts and call any landline or cell phone number in the world for a low per minute fee.
 
All you need is a mobile phone connected to a Wi-Fi hotspot and some credit balance in your account for making the phone call. You can use these VoIP apps when travelling overseas as well and make significant savings for both domestic and international calls.
Now consider a scenario where you have a mobile phone but there’s no Wi-Fi around and the 3G/4G services are either slow or unavailable. Would you still be able to place calls through any of these apps? The answer is obviously in the negative but there’s at least one app that has figured out a unique solution to this common problem.
The app, known as Ringo, lets you make international calls from your mobile phone but “without” requiring the Internet. It does so by cleverly converting your request to dial an international number into a local number.
Let’s say you are trying to call someone in Singapore from India. When you make a call through Ringo, the app will internally dial a local number in India. At the other end in Singapore, it will again make a local call to the desired number and will connect these two calls using their own infrastructure. This process is transparent to the end users though it make few seconds extra to initiate the call.
Here’s a chart comparing the voice calling rates (in cents per minute) for all the popular voice calling apps. Ringo not only allows you make international phone calls without 3G or WiFi but it is cost-effective too.
 
In my testing, I found the voice quality good and the app automatically figures out all the international numbers in your phonebook.  Also when open a contact inside Ringo, it will show their current local time and this little detail does help save a trip to Google.
Is Ringo a replacement for Skype or Google Hangouts? Well, yes and no. With Ringo, you do not need the Internet to make phone calls but you still need a local number. In the case of Skype, you do not need a local number but you have to be connected to the Internet. Also, Ringo is mobile only while Skype lets you call telephone numbers from Mac and Windows PCs as well.
Ringo is available for Android, iPhone and Windows Phone.

It is recommended that you include Related Posts on your blog pages as they help decrease the bounce rate of your site and are good from the SEO perspective. That’s because when you publish a new article, the old content, that was previously hiding in the archives, shows up in the list of related posts and thus gets fresh exposure to both human visitors and search engines. 
 
Matt Cutts, in 2010 when Google search results were a collection of 10 blue links, recommended using related posts and the advice is still relevant today in the age on Penguins and Pandas.

YARPP, short for Yet Another Related Posts Plugin, is the most popular plugin in the WordPress repository for display related articles but it does put lot of strain on your WordPress database server. All the related posts calculations are done using complex SQL queries on your WordPress database and that can affect your website’s performance.
Jetpack, the official WordPress plugins from the makers of WordPress, now includes Related Posts functionality and it is a better alternative to YARPP for one simple reason – Jetpack runs the algorithms to compute related posts in the cloud and thus put no additional load on your server. Through the WordPress plugin, your website makes an API call to Jetpack which in turn returns a list of posts related to the current post.

I’ve obviously replaced YARPP with Jetpack for displaying related posts on labnol.org but there’s something I was not too happy about Jetpack. It adds a number of JavaScript and CSS files to the website’s header for rendering the related posts. This in turn increases the weight of the page but, fortunately, there’s a way around that. 
You can use the Related Posts module of Jetpack but without adding extra baggage to your website. Assuming that the Jetpack plugin is already installed on your website, activate the Related Posts module and then paste this code inside the functions.php file of your WordPress theme.
What we have done so far is dequeued all the extra CSS and JS files that are normally added to the site by Jetpack and we’ve also created a WordPress shortcode that will let us include the Related Post module anywhere on the page (and not limit us to the end or start of an article).
You can also set the number of related posts to display in line #27.
Next open the file where you wish to display related posts, most likely the single.php or loop.php file in the WordPress theme folder, and add this line.
You should also check this page on the Jetpack website for more technical details on how to customize the related posts module of Jetpack.
One more thing. If you have only recently enabled Related Posts for Jetpack, the related posts may not show up on your website because it may take some time for Jetpack servers to index your site.

The prices of products listed on the Amazon shopping website vary every day and a simple Google Spreadsheet can help you keep monitor and track these price fluctuations via email. Just add the items that you wish to buy from Amazon in a spreadsheet and it will send you an email alert when the product’s price drops on Amazon. You’ll thus never miss the deal again.
 
Get daily price alerts for Amazon products via email (see sample)
The Amazon price tracker is easy to configure. All you have to do is add the links (URLs) of Amazon product pages inside a Google Spreadsheet. For instance, here’s the product page for iPad and here’s the search page for iPad – you need to put the URL of the product page in the spreadsheet.
The price tracker is available in free and premium editions. The latter allows you to track 600+ products in a single spreadsheet and you can also set the target price for individual products.
You can buy the Premium version using your credit card or PayPal. It is a flat one-time fee (not a subscription) and you can use the program for life. You also get free technical support over email for 6 months. The Platinum version has all the features of premium and includes one-on-one support over phone, Skype or Google Hangouts for 12 months. Refunds can be requested within 6 hours of purchase. Should you have any questions, or require customization, send an email at amit@labnol.org or visit our services page.
Amazon Tracker can monitor prices of all products (except Kindle ebooks) listed on Amazon.com and the country-specific websites including amazon.fr, amazon.de, amazon.es, amazon.ca, amazon.it, amazon.in, amazon.co.jp and amazon.co.uk. Here’s how you can set up the Amazon price tracker inside Google Docs:
Add products to this Google Sheet to begin tracking their prices
You’ll get an email within a minute or two listing the current prices of products that you have added in the Google Sheet. The sheet will then send you a daily email digest (see sample email) of the product whose prices have changed since the last update.
Also, you can add more Amazon URLs, or delete existing products, from the Google sheet and the script will automatically pick the changes in the next run. And if you ever wish to stop receiving those email alerts, just choose the Stop Tracking option from the Price Tracker menu in the same Google sheet.
Internally, the Google Script uses Amazon’s Product Advertising API to fetch the latest prices of Amazon products.

 (90,'Fashion','http://www.teenvogue.com/my-life/2015-06/unhealthy-excercise-addiction-story','What Happens When a Workout Obsession Goes Totally Wrong


When I was 16, I joined a gym. Well, my mother joined for me—beyond fronting the joining fee, the state of California mandated that she be the one to sign the paperwork and grant permission that I could go on my own. I was nervous and overly chatty, and sure that this was the ticket to success. Just outside of the sales rep''s office was the answer that had eluded me despite countless diets and many miserable, begrudging miles in gym class. My legs wouldn''t jiggle. I might even get them to not touch. I would finally be thin.


Except that''s not how it—pardon the pun—worked out.


Nothing happened. I trudged to the gym every morning before school, keeping my gym bag stashed in the trunk of my hand-me-down car. I sweated bullets on the elliptical, climbed endless stairs to nowhere, ran my heart out...and did it all again after school, too. I would work out longer, at higher intensities, bought fitness magazines and tried a new routine every other day, and my body changed a little, but not anywhere near how I thought it should. I wasn''t working out that much and that hard for minimal results. 


On top of that, I was miserable. My body was exhausted from constantly training, and yet I continued to cut out entire food groups because I wasn''t interested in refueling my muscles properly—I just wanted to lose weight. I would constantly update my playlists to try to distract myself from the fact that I hated every single moment. I started going to the gym at times when I knew there was something I''d want to watch on TV. I woke up earlier and earlier because I knew it would take that much more time to convince myself to get out of bed and actually go to the gym at all. If, as Elle Woods said, "exercise gives you endorphins and endorphins make you happy," I wasn''t buying it. 


We live in a world that is constantly touting the new workout class, the new boutique gym, the new way to get "guaranteed results" quickly, that it''s often impossible to tell who is telling the truth—if anyone even is. And between thigh gaps, crop tops, abs of steel, and flattering selfie angles, it''s dizzying to think that we might ever get to a point where we can just be happy with our bodies. It''s not enough to work out—you have to work out and achieve results. Fast.


When you''re not naturally inclined to athleticism or on a sports team, working out can feel like a huge chore. Even if you are either of those things, hearing a coach telling you to put in work can drag on your willpower, especially on days when you feel like you''ve hit a wall. "We spend the majority of our days doing things for others—school, work, commitments. Fitness is one of the few things we do that is just for ourselves," says Emily Newman, Certified Health Coach and founder of MOVE YOUR BOOTY. Sure, you might join the track team because your older sister was a cross-country star or to boost how your transcript looks for college applications, but the way to keep showing up to practice after practice is to love what you''re doing, and to have fun. And, unless there''s a weight class requirement involved, few athletes are fixated on making their legs look slimmer or carving up their abs. Instead, they''re focused on performance—getting stronger, faster, better. Not skinnier. 


In fact, dieting while training can harm your muscles more than help them. Professionals constantly warn that not eating enough can actually cause your body to hold onto the calories it does receive and stall any results you might be trying to achieve. Yet according to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, over half of teenage girls have tried to lose weight in ways that could be described as potentially harmful, and 9 out of 10 young women have been on a diet by the time they enter college. I remember trying to cut carbs out of my diet out of my own volition when I was 11, and that behavior spiraled into an eating disorder by the time I was 15. By the time I had joined the gym, I was exhibiting symptoms of exercise bulimia—which is to say, I would purge my body of the calories I was eating by working out. 


And as far as workout tactics go, overtraining is a highly inefficient one, and can actually be less effective than not working out at all. "People quickly forget that your body needs a second to bounce back from those 20 squats and 10 burpees," says Chayanne Joël, a group fitness instructor for Equinox Fitness in New York City. "Our bodies need rest to complement the workouts we endure in order to rebuild and grow. You also need a mental break from the dumbbells and cardio machines." Forcing yourself to ignore a wall might seem like a feat of willpower and motivation, but sometimes, ignoring your body''s signals that it wants to stop isn''t the best idea. 


All of this was happening before Instagram, Tumblr, or any other social media platform where shots of tan and taut abs and cut-up fruit can easily overload your feed. "Some accounts post only professionally shot photos of models on beaches with hashtags like #fitspo and #goals. Although these can be motivating, keep in mind these were shot on a professional grade camera, retouched, angled, and lit to appear perfect," says Joël. You can bookmark healthy recipes and shots of athletic, smiling women doing tricep dips on Pinterest, like ever image posted to a hashtag on Instagram, and set up entire Tumblrs dedicated to talking about your fitness journey and reblogging more images along the way—and all without so much as breaking a sweat or getting outside. It''s one thing to collect imagery that might motivate you, but it''s another to lose yourself in a world that makes you feel in any way less-than simply because you are not a fitness model. 


"If your workout is producing anxiety or coming from a place of punishment, stress or panic, it''s time to reassess the role fitness is playing in your life," says Newman. "The dirty secret of ''being healthy'' is that fun nights out with friends, decadent dinners, and pizza on the couch are all a part of a healthy and balanced life." None of those images are going to show a model''s "cheat meal" because that''s not the lifestyle any brand is selling. In fact, because social media allows the user to be selective in choosing what they do and do not share with the rest of the world, you could be posting a photo of the new Nikes that just carried you through a grueling three-hour workout—and conveniently leave out the fact that you were at the gym long enough to watch a movie on your iPad. Perceived health is rarely the full story.


Slowly, I weaned myself off from the gym, and began to run in the park by my college''s campus. I''d challenge myself to run longer—maybe for an extra song or to a landmark that was just that much further—and, to my surprise, I found that I liked running. Not only that, but I wanted to see exactly how far I could go. I signed up for a half-marathon, and trained for weeks with a plan that a coach had mapped out for me. Signing up for a race is a specific plan with a built-in end date, and as much a mental finish line as a physical one. (Joël says that one of the best ways to spur yourself onward is to "create a specific, attainable goal, and make a starting point" from which you can measure that goal.) 


My workouts began to gradually involve distances longer than I''d ever run before, and I would typically end them at coffee shops where I''d treat myself to a cookie for having run for so long. (The longer a run, the bigger a cookie, right?) I also began meeting up with with friends who I knew were runners, especially on days when I felt like I couldn''t eke out another mile, something Newman suggests. 


Over the course of the months I spent training, I also began to notice how my body was changing, too. My legs were looking better than ever and my clothes were fitting differently. But how my body looked was no longer my priority. I wanted to cross a finish line, and a smaller jeans size wasn''t going to help carry me over 13 miles (plus some). And even after I traded what was essentially a two-hour workout for a shiny medal and bragging rights, I knew I''d continue running. 


I found what worked for me, and though I stopped hating my thighs in the process, it wasn''t because they''d suddenly turned into modelesque pins. Instead, I had grown to appreciate what my legs could do. They could propel me through my workouts, and help me achieve that kind of mental bliss that so many people talk about when they say they need a workout. Endorphins can make you happy, after all—it just depends on why you''re trying to get them.

And now, there''s a story that makes the idea of public shaming even more sad. Thirteen-year-old Izabel Laxamana of Tacoma, Washington, committed suicide on May 29 by exiting a moving vehicle and jumping off of a highway overpass.
According to a website her friends set up in honor of her, justiceforizabel.com, this horrible tragedy happened a few days after a video was posted online showing her cutting off her hair in punishment for something she did. 
A blogger who saw the video described what happened in the 15-second clip: 


"It showed a young girl who appeared to be twelve or thirteen years old. She''s standing in a room looking at the phone camera. She appears to be afraid. The camera then shows the floor where there is a pile of long black hair. 
A taunting male voice says, ''The consequences of getting messed up? Man, you lost all that beautiful hair. Was it worth it?'' 
The girl stares at her hair on the floor. She very quietly says, ''No.'' 
''How many times did I warn you?'' 
She almost inaudibly says, ''Twice.'' 
He then says, ''Okay.'' as if he has proved a point. The video ends."
In a Google+ post last year, Izabel expressed loneliness and not fitting in at school. For someone who was most likely already feeling depressed and anxious, a public shaming of this sort would only add to those negative feelings.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide is the third leading cause of death for people between the ages of 10-24. A nationwide survey of high school students found that "16 percent of students reported seriously considering suicide, 13 percent reported creating a plan, and eight percent reporting trying to take their own life in the 12 months preceding the survey." 


Those numbers are scary, and while there are many different things that contribute to suicidal thoughts, it''s important to be aware of stories like Izabel''s so that we can prevent others like hers in the future. It''s time to put an end to public-shaming. Parents and adults are always speaking out against bullying, but don''t they realize this is exactly what they''re doing to their kids when they do this?
We hope that Izabel''s story can serve as a wake-up call for those who think punishing their kids online is the way to go. Perhaps Izabel''s "lesson" can be the ultimate lesson for parents.

Life hasn''t always been easy for Selena Gomez. We grew up with the star, watching her completely steal the screen on Disney''s Wizards of Waverly Place, jump into acting with Spring Breakers, and release big-time hits like "Come & Get It." We also watched some ups and downs in her relationships, friendships, and her health. Honestly, she''s just like any of us—she''s not perfect, and she knows that. In fact, she loves that. And there are some other things she really wants the world to know about her, too.
After seeing some new stories come out about her, the star is fighting back on Instagram. Instead of the media supporting her, old news is resurfacing as new and it''s leaving the brunette beauty more frustrated than ever as she tries to leave the past in the past. After seeing the headlines about her being "forced into rehab," she decided to set things straight once and for all.

 Sometimes I get frustrated when I hear lies about who I am. The Internet is meant to keep you "updated" but it just takes old news and freezes it like it''s now. You have watched me in pain and I''ve owned up to it through my music and actions. I grew up with you. I am beyond excited to show you the next chapter, the TRUTH. I''ve been keeping so many secrets... I''m reborn in every moment so who knows what I''ll become.. As long as I''m happy with me. #strongisbeautiful #healthyperspectiveonthemfools =

In her message, Selena not only shared how her fans have watched her in pain and how she''s owned up to what''s been going on in her life, but most importantly how she''s ready to move forward. Unfortunately, the internet isn''t letting her do that as easily as she hoped. Don''t worry, though—she promised this next chapter will hold the truth, and one other very important thing: her happiness.
We couldn''t be more proud of Selena for standing up for herself against those people who are only trying to bring her down. We''ve got your back, girl.

Jamie Chung is a familiar face (and voice!) in silver screen hits like The Hangover and Big Hero 6, sits front row at the most sought-after runway shows, and somehow manages to find the time to write for her blog, What The Chung, on a regular basis. And now, Jamie has another impressive job on her résumé as the newest face of Make Up For Ever.


While inking this deal is a pretty sweet career-making moment for Jamie, the announcement also sets a great example for the ongoing need for more diversity in the beauty industry. Even though Asians make up more than half of the world''s population, many trends and advertisements are still catered to the same definition of western beauty. To promote Make Up For Ever''s "Be Bold. Be Unexpected. Be You." campaign, the actress-slash-blogger will empower people all around the world to look and feel their best—no matter your race or gender.



 HUGE thank you @makeupforeverofficial #BeMAKEUPFOREVER =

A photo posted by Jamie Chung (@jamiejchung) on Jun 3, 2015 at 3:18pm PDT

It sounds like a tall order, but Jamie will be in good company—the brand also tapped transgender model Andreja Pejic to front the campaign alongside the star. We think the collaboration is a great fit for both personalities, and we can''t wait to see the different ways each of the ambassadors will get creative with the brand''s upcoming makeup launches. 



Besides, after years of experimenting with beauty products and learning first-hand tips from the biggest artists in the biz, Jamie''s quite the natural when it comes to makeup. Below, she shares her four favorite tricks—specifically geared for Asian facial features:


Focus on your cheekbones. "Many Asian women naturally have these amazing, high cheekbones. No matter your face shape, you can accentuate them use a bright blush like the Make Up For Ever Sculpting Blush in #22 and apply it about two inches away from your nose towards the middle of your cheek," says Jamie. "I found that starting the blush any closer to your nose shortens your facial features. Next, apply a little bit of bronzer just below your cheekbone and a touch of shimmery golden higher to the apples. No crazy contouring necessary—that''s all it takes to make your cheek bones pop."


Try a bold red lip. "Red lips look particularly great on fair complexions. Prep your lips by patting on a touch of your foundation with a sponge—it helps bind the color to your lips so it lasts all day long. Always try to use a lipstick brush to first outline your lips with the lip color then fill them in with the same brush. It gives you better control over the application and creates that clean, crisp line," says Jamie. 


Fill in your eyebrows. "Many Asians tend to have eyebrows that are more sparse. Filling them in is a simple step that really brings great definition to your facial features. Make Up For Ever Aqua Brow is a creamy gel that glides on really naturally. Just use an angled eyebrow brush and apply a tiny amount of product to the base line of your brow with small, even strokes in the same direction your eyebrow hairs grow. Don''t forget to dab your brush frequently on a tissue to remove clumps and achieve an even application," says Jamie.


Apply the right shade of foundation. "For people with fair or pale complexions, I found that the most flattering foundation shades match the skin on your neck. This usually means going one shade lighter than your facial skin tone. Streakiness is an issue when you deal with fairer skin, and a kabuki brush helps make sure you''re really blending the foundation completely and seamlessly," says Jamie.

"This is so surreal," explains 18-year-old actress Stefanie Scott before stepping out onto the red carpet for the premiere of her new movie, Insidious: Chapter 3, which debuts in theaters today. "The first time I saw my face on a 200-foot high billboard, I had to pull the car over because I started to tear up. I''ve worked so hard this past year, especially on this film, and I''m truly grateful for all the doors it has opened for me already. " 


It''s not just Stefanie''s down-to-earth personality and acting chops that we love, but a few things that set her apart from the Hollywood pack. For starters, the former Disney star, who plays Quinn in the horror sequel, did all her own stunts in the new film. And anyone who can pull off a 15-hour shift pretending to get thrown from a bed one day and then look calm, cute and collected in a floral Dolce & Gabbana crop top the next, is seriously ace in our book. 


Speaking of style, the movie keeps Stefanie in a specific aesthetic: "My character has a very vintage, ''70s look. She also listens to a lot of Jeff Buckley, The Pixies and Joni Mitchell, and I think they really influence her vibe as well," says Stefanie. Off-screen, she takes a more feminine, sophisticated approach to fashion—as evidenced by last night''s French ballerina-inspired Vivienne Westwood dress she wore to the premiere.

There have been rumors swirling that Harry Styles will be the next member to leave One Direction, so he''s setting the record straight about his plans, once and for all. Directioners can relax now, because this guy isn''t going anywhere. Right now, his sole focus is working on the next album with Niall, Liam, and Louis.
"We have the album and the tour that we''re working on right now. I think when you have so many goals that you feel like you have yet to achieve, it''s hard to kind of see past those," he told Ryan Seacrest. "It''s important to kind of focus on what''s going on and [not] lose track. So we''re all working hard toward the same thing right now, and I don''t think we''re thinking much past that. We''re just having a lot of fun and we''re working hard and we''re having a good time."
The only other thing on his career path is writing for other artists, which he enjoys for creativity. "We all enjoy writing so much that sometimes you write a song you like that just doesn''t necessarily work," he said of his recent collaborations with artists like Meghan Trainor. "It''s also nice kind of writing from different points of view—and writing for other people is definitely fun."
As for new 1D music, we can expect that "toward the end of the year." Let the countdown begin.

The boss of accident-hit Alton Towers has told Sky News safety measures "weren''t adequate" at the attraction - as four rollercoasters at three theme parks were shut.
Nick Varney, chief executive of Merlin Entertainment, which runs several UK theme parks, said "another layer" of safety was being added to existing rides.
Alton Towers has been closed since the Smiler ride came to an abrupt halt when two carriages collided, injuring 16 people, on Tuesday.
Four of the passengers were seriously hurt, suffering "significant lower limb injuries" . The park is due to reopen "within the next few days".
Dragon''s Fury, at Chessington World of Adventures, is also closed
Today, Merlin announced it had temporarily shut some other rollercoasters, as well as Smiler.
These are Saw at Merlin''s Thorpe Park site, and two rides at Chessington World of Adventures - Dragon’s Fury and Rattlesnake.
The closures were to "reinforce the safe operation" of the attractions, a statement said.
Mr Varney declined to comment on reports one passenger had lost a leg following the crash.
But he told Sky News "a rather unique set of circumstances (might) have played a contributory factor in the Smiler accident".
He said: "What we have done today is put in another level of additional safety measures across all of our parks that operate these types of rides. 
"All of them - bar two - have been able to implement those new procedures today.
"The two rides at Chessington that are currently suspended will take a few days before we can make the technical and training adjustments to bring them up to the new level of safety protocol - it doesn''t mean they were not safe before.
"I think we have had very rigorous protocols across all our attractions.
"We have had the first - and I hope only accident - in one of our theme parks. We have to make sure that doesn''t happen again.
"(Safety measures) clearly weren''t adequate on Smiler, because the accident happened.
"We have taken steps to upgrade safety standards from what were already very stringent safety standards.
"I want to be able to look everybody in the eye and promise them when they come to our parks and get on our rides that they are safe."
Meanwhile, the Health and Safety Executive says it is removing the carriages involved in the Smiler crash, for laboratory testing.
A prohibition notice has been served on the rollercoaster to stop its use until action has been taken to deal with the cause of the failure.
Gerstlauer, a rollercoaster company based in Germany, manufactured The Smiler and Saw - costing millions of pounds.
Visitors to Thorpe Park have complained on Twitter about the closure of Saw, which has been withdrawn from service since Tuesday.
Two other rides at the Surrey attraction, Colossus and Stealth, have also been closed today for "unrelated" reasons.
Merlin Entertainments is losing £500,000 in revenue for every day that Alton Towers remains closed.
On Thursday, it was confirmed there was an 11-minute delay before 999 were called after The Smiler crash.
Alton Towers had previously claimed the emergency services were "called immediately".
The Smiler, which cost an estimated £18m to build, had been closed twice before because of safety concerns.
It boasts a world record for being the rollercoaster with the most loops.
In Tuesday''s crash, textile design student Joe Pugh, 18, and 17-year-old girlfriend Leah Washington, were badly hurt.
Victoria Balch, from Leyland in Lancashire, is in a "critical" condition following the crash, her lawyer said.
The other person seriously injured in the incident has been named as Daniel Thorpe, a hotel assistant manager from Buxton in Derbyshire.

One of the teenagers seriously injured in the Alton Towers crash is expected to make a "substantial claim for damages", her lawyer said.
Vicky Balch, 19, from Leyland in Lancashire, is in a "serious condition" in hospital, according to Paul Paxton, partner at Stewarts Law.
Earlier, Mr Paxton had said Miss Balch was in a "critical" condition, but this had now been downgraded. 
Victoria Balch
He said: "Whilst it is anticipated that there will be a substantial claim for damages to support Victoria in her recovery, the main focus at present for the family is Victoria''s well-being and ensuring that the investigation into the accident is carried out swiftly and vigorously.
"They have every confidence in the police and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).
"It is expected that serious consideration will be given to criminal prosecutions. The family are distraught that a fun day out could turn into such a potentially life-changing disaster."
Ms Balch is among four people seriously injured after Alton Towers'' Smiler ride came to a crashing halt on Tuesday afternoon when two carriages collided.
The other three seriously hurt have been named as Daniel Thorpe, a 27-year-old hotel assistant manager from Buxton in Derbyshire, textile design student Joe Pugh, 18, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, and his girlfriend, Leah Washington, 17.
Nick Varney, chief executive of Merlin Entertainments which runs the Staffordshire visitor attraction, today said safety measures "were not adequate" at Alton Towers and defended the decision to close a number of other rides.
He said the group was adding "another layer" of safety measures to existing rides as a "precaution" against the prospect of another accident.

By Jon Craig, Chief Political Correspondent
The bribery scandal in FIFA should spur the international community to target the "cancer" of corruption around the globe, David Cameron will tell world leaders at a G7 summit this weekend.
At talks in Bavaria, the Prime Minister will call for an international effort to root out corruption, claiming it is holding back economic growth and human development all over the world.
Ahead of the G7, Mr Cameron said: "In the last fortnight we have seen the stark truth about FIFA. The body governing football has faced appalling allegations that suggests it is absolutely riddled with corruption.
Last year''s summit in Brussels
"And (Sepp) Blatter''s resignation this week presents an opportunity to clean up the game we love. It is also an opportunity to learn a broader lesson about tackling corruption.
"Just as with FIFA, we know the problem is there, but there is something of an international taboo over pointing the finger and stirring up concerns. At international summits, leaders meet to talk about aid, economic growth and how to keep our people safe. But we just don''t talk enough about corruption.
"This has got to change. We have to show some of the same courage that exposed FIFA and break the taboo on talking about corruption."
"Corruption is the cancer at the heart of so many of the problems we face around the world today," Mr Cameron said, adding that corruption "doesn''t just threaten our prosperity, it also undermines our security." 
"Football is beginning a long journey to rid itself of corruption and it will take time, courage and determination to see through the reforms that FIFA needs. I believe world leaders must show the same courage and determination to tackle corruption around the globe. That will be my mission tomorrow at the G7 and in the months and years ahead."
Mr Cameron will join US President Barack Obama, French President Francois Hollande, Italian PM Matteo Renzi, Canadian PM Stephen Harper and Japanese PM Shinzo Abe for the two-day gathering, hosted at Schloss Elmau in the Bavarian Alps by Germany''s Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Mrs Merkel has put climate change and sustainable development at the top of the agenda for the annual summit of the world''s leading industrialised economies beginning on Sunday, which will also focus on growth, security and the threat from terrorism and disease epidemics.
But Mr Cameron will argue that the issue of corruption - which he put at the heart of the UK''s agenda for its presidency of the body in 2013 - has a bearing on all these areas and must be discussed openly as part of the debate.
He will cite World Bank estimates that corruption adds 10% to business costs worldwide, with $1tn (£650bn) paid in bribes every year.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) believes corruption costs around 5% of global GDP annually, while in developing countries it can add 25% to the cost of procurement, Mr Cameron will say.
Seven of the 10 most corrupt countries in sub-Saharan Africa are also in the bottom 10 on the human development index and infant mortality is twice as high in countries with the most corruption as in those with the least.
Mr Cameron will say that there is an onus on world leaders to do what they can to tackle the issue, and will call for action in the coming months to focus the efforts of the various international organisations tasked with combating corruption and ensure that they are working effectively with one another.
Anti-corruption measures should be at the heart of the new United Nations development goals for the coming 15 years due to be agreed in September, he will say.
Demonstrations over climate change, wealth inequality and the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) US/EU free trade deal are expected outside the heavily guarded G7 venue, with a protest camp set up in the nearby town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen and around 35,000 attending a pre-summit rally in Munich on Thursday.

Disaster teams have found hundreds more bodies overnight and on Saturday morning after pulling the overturned river cruise boat upright with cranes and gradually raising it up from the currents of the river.
The state broadcaster CCTV said 331 bodies have been found. That leaves more than 100 still missing.

Fourteen people survived, including the captain and first engineer who have been placed under police custody.
Chinese authorities began on Thursday to right the cruise ship, after divers sent to search for survivors found no signs of life inside.
A huge net was placed near the two large cranes that were used to right the ship, and another one a few metres downstream, to catch any bodies.
Two smaller cranes were also on site and boats were stopped from entering the area.
After the capsizing, there were claims that there was never a tornado.
Some of the 14 people who survived the disaster jumped from the ship during the early moments and swam ashore.
Three of them were pulled by divers from air pockets inside the overturned hull on Tuesday after rescuers heard yells for help coming from inside.

Former FIFA vice president Jack Warner refused to comment on the football corruption scandal, as his bodyguards manhandled a Sky News correspondent.
The indicted football executive was surrounded by journalists as he left parliament in Port of Spain, Trinidad, where he is an MP.
Sky''s David Bowden asked him what had happened to the $10m he allegedly pocketed for helping South Africa win the race to host the 2010 World Cup.
Warner, 72, remained tight-lipped as his security team kept up a chorus of "no comment".
Bowden continued his questions and was pushed and shoved by a thick-set bodyguard.
"Can you stop pushing me!" Bowden said, before asking a nearby police officer whether he was "going to stop this man assaulting me?"
Bowden then asked Warner: "As a parliamentarian, do you think it''s right that your associates are assaulting me?"
"Move, move, move!" the bodyguards continued as they helped the former president of the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) into a waiting car.
Warner was arrested at the request of US authorities as part of their investigation into corruption within the world governing body.
He spent a night in custody and was released on bail, pending a decision in his extradition case, which could take up to a year.
Warner said he fears for his life and has threatened to divulge an "avalanche" of dirty secrets about FIFA and its outgoing president Sepp Blatter.
On Friday, he blamed a conspiracy by Trinidadian Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar, his one-time ally, for the corruption charges against him.
He has also accused the US of conspiring against him because it lost its bid to host the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.
Blatter announced he will step down despite winning a fifth term as president, following a string of arrests as part of the US Department of Justice''s corruption probe.

Thousands of fans of One Direction and the Manic Street Preachers endured 45 miles of delays on the M4 as they headed to Cardiff for two shows last night.
Tailbacks began to build in Wales on Friday afternoon as the music lovers travelled from England to 1D''s concert at the Millennium Stadium and to the Manics'' gig at Cardiff Castle.
Traffic Wales said drivers had to cope with 45 miles of delays with stop-start traffic stretching from junction 17 at Chippenham, Wiltshire, to junction 26 at Malpas, Newport.
At one point it took travellers an hour and 45 minutes to get from junction 17 to junction 22 before they were hit by another 45 minute delay as they continued their journey through to junction 26.
A Traffic Wales spokesman said the "horrendous" delays were "definitely because of the two concerts".
Similar traffic jams were seen when the 2010 Ryder Cup was staged at Celtic Manor, but the spokesman added it was "not something you see every day".
He said there had been no accidents but the queues were caused by "just the sheer volume of traffic".

Two blasts have ripped through a Kurdish rally in Turkey, killing two people and injuring more than 100 in the run-up to Sunday''s parliamentary election.
President Tayyip Erdogan described the blasts as a "provocation" designed to undermine peace before this weekend''s vote.
The explosions occurred as tens of thousands of people gathered for the pro-Kurdish Peoples'' Democratic Party (HDP) election rally in Diyarbakir.
Diyarbakir is the largest city in mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey.
Initial reports said there had been one explosion but a senior security source told Reuters there were two blasts. 
An injured man is carried after one of the explosions
Officials initially blamed a faulty power transformer at the rally site but later ruled that possibility out.
Eyewitness Guy Martin, a British photographer, told Reuters the blasts occurred some five minutes apart.

In the aftermath Mr Martin saw one person who had lost a leg and others with shrapnel wounds.
"It was a heart-shaking, ribcage-shaking noise," he said of one of the blasts.
"The most terrifying thing is that crush of people. It was chaos, I couldn''t move, people were panicking.
"The police started firing tear gas at people who were helping the injured or fleeing the scene - this enflamed the situation.
"The mood is angry. People want revenge."

The explosions killed two people and injured more than 100, Mr Erdogan said in an interview with broadcaster ATV.
"It is very important that all our citizens are careful in the face of provocations like this aimed at undermining our democracy, the atmosphere of peace and brotherhood in our country," he said in a statement.
Tensions have run high as the HDP campaigns to become the first party with Kurdish origins to win seats in parliament in Sunday''s election.
Previously, Kurdish MPs have joined the legislature as independents.
The HDP needs to overcome a 10% vote threshold.
Some opinion polls show it could seize enough seats to deprive the long-ruling AK Party of the majority it has enjoyed since sweeping to power in 2002.

Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, who deliberately flew a passenger plane into a mountain, sought help from "dozens" of doctors before the crash.
The 27-year-old put Germanwings Flight 9525 from Barcelona to Düsseldorf into a deep descent over the French Alps on 24 March, killing all 150 people on board.
French prosecutor Brice Robin, heading the criminal investigation, said Lubitz had contacted numerous doctors in the weeks before the incident, suggesting he was desperate to find help for some mental or physical ailment.
Mr Robin declined to say what condition Lubitz was suffering from.
Germanwings and parent company Lufthansa refused to comment on the news, citing the ongoing investigation.

They said Lubitz - who had a history of depression - had passed all medical tests and was cleared by doctors as fit to fly.
Relatives of those killed said they were not informed Lubitz had seen so many doctors.
Retired US teacher Robert Tansill Oliver, whose 36-year-old son Robert Oliver Calvo died in the tragedy, said the development was "devastating, just devastating".
He was also critical of news that the remains of some victims will not be sent home next week as originally planned.
"Every time we see news like this it''s like another plane crash," he said.
Plans to repatriate victims'' remains were put on hold because of errors on death certificates and issues over embalming.                  
In the week before the crash, Lubitz researched suicide methods and cockpit door security on the internet - the earliest evidence of a premeditated act.
Investigators have also said they found a sick note for the day of the crash at Lubitz''s home, but it was never given to the airline.
He was reportedly being treated by psychologists and neurologists and authorities believe he was trying to hide this from his employers.
According to a series of leaks from the German investigation in March, there was a serious issue with Lubitz''s eyesight.
Doctors were unable to find a cause, and believed it could have been psychosomatic.

By Ian Woods, Senior Correspondent
Britain''s 100m Olympic Gold medallist Allan Wells has denied using performance-enhancing drugs during his career.
Allegations were made by a former teammate in a BBC Panorama investigation.
But the sprinter, who won his gold in the 1980 Moscow games, said it was won with "honesty and sincerity and commitment".
Panorama broadcast an interview with Drew McMaster, who has admitted using steroids in the past. 
He said Wells was given the drugs by British team doctor Jimmy Ledingham, who has since died.

In his first TV interview about the allegations, Wells told Sky News: "The commitment that I had was above and beyond anyone else''s that I was training with.
"I was taking food supplements, I was taking vitamins, I was taking high-calorie energy sources, and at times I did think I overdid it."
But he repeatedly denied he had taken anything illegal which contributed to his powerful physique.
"I did put on weight, but certainly not as discussed the other night. That was disgusting. I''ve never been 14 stone.
The Scotsman is determined to hold on to his gold medal
"It''s all about the food supplements and the hard training."
Two of the teammates who helped Wells win a gold in the Commonwealth Games 100m relay have admitted using drugs. 
Wells now accepts he does not deserve to keep it.
"I''ve still got the medal. I''m not unhappy to give it back," he said.
But he is determined to hold on to his Olympic gold.
"I would definitely be unhappy to give it back under any circumstances," he added.
"You know that was won with honesty and sincerity and commitment."

They arrived in the broiling heat of Berlin on Friday with different motivations. Juventus came with the memories of Heysel and its victims in their hearts, Barcelona driven by a desire to prove that the quiet evolution of recent months has not taken anything from their unique genius.
Ultimately, though, the quest is the same as it has always been before this grand occasion. When you get here, when you stand on the doorstep, it is about finding one last performance to get you through the door.
On the face of it, the greater challenge at Berlin’s iconic Olympiastadion belongs to the Italian champions from Turin. Their journey to Germany has been a surprising one.
Scroll down for video 
‘I must admit I thought this would take two or three years,’ said Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon.
For Barcelona, however, expectation always sits heavy. Having won Europe’s blue riband competition twice in three years under Pep Guardiola in 2009 and 2011, the Catalan club threatened to take ownership of the trophy until their coach decided to take a time out.
Here on Saturday, after the relatively fallow years of the late Tito Vilanova and Gerardo Martino, coach Luis Enrique has the opportunity to underline the generally accepted feeling that Barcelona — the Barca of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar — are once again the greatest club side in the world. From that point of view, failure is not an option.
‘We have an amazing team,’ said Barcelona defender Gerard Pique. ‘We have one of the best teams in the history of our club. This game is something we have been working towards all season and we are not in the mood to fail now.’
3 - A goal would see Lionel Messi become the first player to score in three Champions League finals
6 - Juventus players who have covered more ground in Europe this season than Barca’s most active player, Neymar
2 - All but two of Barca’s 28 Champions League goals have been scored from inside the box — six of Juve’s 16 strikes have been from distance
6 -Juventus have lost five European Cup/CL finals — level with Bayern Munich and Benfica — defeat tonight would set a new record
A month ago, neutrals would perhaps have hoped for a Barcelona-Real Madrid final. Seeing el clasico as a roadshow certainly would have been something. In ending that story at the semi-final stage, however, Juventus showed that they will provide Barcelona with something more than a lesson in obduracy on what promises to be a stiflingly hot evening.
In the first leg in Turin in particular, Massimiliano Allegri’s team unsettled Real with their direct and energetic counter-attacking play. Carlos Tevez, who won and scored a penalty, appeared young again while Arturo Vidal and Claudio Marchisio provided a midfield platform that will be fundamental if Juventus are to see enough of the ball in key areas.
‘We will expect to have the ball and control possession and they will counter-attack,’ added Pique. ‘They have a lot of power up front and some good midfielders who are strong and go box to box.
‘They are an Italian team but they always want to play with the ball. They showed that against Madrid and will try and do the same to us.’
Sitting alongside Pique at last night’s Barcelona press conference was the Brazilian, Neymar. His verbal offerings were nothing like as expansive as his work on the field but he did cast the trophy a covetous glance as he walked into the room.
‘This is the most important match of my life,’ he said. ‘It has been a dream since I was a child to win this cup. Leo (Messi) and Luis (Suarez) are two extraordinary players and I am just lucky to play with them and learn from them.’
Juventus, it seems, know their place ahead of the final but, equally, the role of underdog is not one that sits particularly well with the two-time winners of the competition.
‘We know we are one step below Barcelona but this is only one game so the difference is reduced,’ said defender Leonardo Bonucci.
‘We are not here to be sacrificial lambs or victims. Juventus have always had a reputation for great players, great champions, many trophies, and that makes us aware of what we have to live up to. This is a club that wins things.’
The first time Juventus won the European Cup, of course, was in 1985. Recently the club, along with Liverpool, marked the 30-year anniversary of a match — and a disaster — at Heysel Stadium that claimed 39 lives.
On Friday coach Allegri and his players struck the appropriate tone. ‘It is very important,’ said Allegri. ‘Thirty years ago we saw a tragedy which is going to stay with us and has gone down in the history of football. So I think for Juventus, for Italian fans and for world football, this year is a year to be remembered. Most importantly, we have to think about the families of the victims.’
On the field, Allegri will miss his defensive rock Giorgio Chiellini, absent with a calf injury. That at least saves us from the sideshow of a reunion with his World Cup assailant, Suarez. There is, of course, still the prospect of Suarez’s reunion with Juventus’s former Manchester United left back Patrice Evra to think about.
It is to be hoped that storyline does not break the surface of what could be an absorbing game. The Olympiastadion is a venue worthy of a classic and we could get one.

Everton have confirmed the signing of midfielder Tom Cleverley from Manchester United on a free transfer with the 25-year-old agreeing to a five-year deal at Goodison Park.
He spent last season on loan at Aston Villa and manager Tim Sherwood had hoped to make the move permanent, but Cleverley has opted to link up with former boss Roberto Martinez instead.
Cleverley played under Martinez at Wigan on another loan spell from United during the 2010-11 campaign and scored four goals in 25 appearances, as the Lancashire club avoided relegation from the Premier League. 
Scroll down for video 
On Cleverley''s arrival, Martinez told Everton''s official website, ''We are extremely delighted to be welcoming Tom and I can think of many reasons as to why our fans will enjoy Tom representing our football club.
''The most important one is that he is a perfect fit for what we are trying to build here as he has so much experience of playing in the Premier League and he still has his best years just ahead of him.'' 

Cleverley, who has 13 senior caps for England, underwent a medical at the Toffees'' Finch Farm training ground on Friday and is the club''s first signing of the summer. The deal is set be finalised on July 1 when his contract at United expires.  
Cleverley''s last appearance for Villa came in the 4-0 defeat by Arsenal in the FA Cup final.

Aaron Ramsey does not believe Arsenal need a marquee signing to make a serious challenge for the title next season - but does think it would help if Arsene Wenger moved him into a central role.
That stationing out wide has been one of the few bugbears for the Welshman, who is convinced Wenger has all the players he needs to run at the crown, so long as Arsenal make the most of not having to qualify for the Champions League Group stages.
That was not a luxury Arsenal had this season when they had to squeeze in a two-legged qualifier with Besiktas among a distinctly mediocre set of Premier League results.

Along with injuries, not least to himself, Ramsey believes those factors were crucial to an 11th straight season without a title.
But, having taken back-to-back FA Cups, Ramsey is certain Arsenal are able to make the next step, even if they do not go ahead with planned moves for Southampton''s £25m midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin, among others.
He said: ''Every club brings in a new faces and a few will leave. But even with this group of players now I believe if everyone was fit in the season we would have a great opportunity of competing for the Premier League.
''This team has come on a lot over the last few years and if we can get off to a good start next season we will challenge.
''The club is in a good place. They don''t have to let players go and we''re building on this team rather than players leaving and you have to rebuild around those left. It is a nice feeling and means that the group can stick together. The understanding is there already so it can only get stronger.''
Asked about switching from his wide role to a central position, as he does for Wales, he added: ''That''s my favourite position and where I play my best football. I''m very happy playing back in the middle for Wales. I had a chat with him (Wenger) a few times and he said it was temporary (out wide).
''It means I can time my runs into the box better. When you''re wide you''re taught to try and get in at the far post so the ball doesn''t go straight across. From that central position you can use your instinct where to go rather than just try and get in at the far post.'' 

As a collective, Arsenal''s chances next season will surely be enhanced by finishing third this time, thereby ensuring they miss the sapping extra work of a Champions League qualifier. 
Ramsey added: ''At the beginning of the season you''re still getting your fitness levels up and those first few games are quite tough. If you sandwich a few Champions League fixtures in between them that''s maybe too much for certain players at that time of the season. 
''So it''s important to go through to the group stages without having that knock-out game to qualify. It''s a good thing for us not to have those games and hopefully get us off to a very strong start.''
It''s been another impressive season for Ramsey for club and country with Arsenal winning the FA Cup and Wales topping their European Championship qualification group.
But the 24-year-old does not believe he reached the levels of the previous campaign when he scored a career-best 16 in 34 matches. His hope is that next season he will be given more of an opportunity in the central role he plays for Wales.
Talking at an event with Vauxhall, the Wales team sponsor, Ramsey said: ''Last season was one of those seasons where everything just clicked in. I was top of the stats for a quite a lot of things and to be in that sort of form is quite special.
''This season I think I''ve done pretty well but I''ve been injured a few times - and not just in one block. It''s been a bit stop-start and you don''t get consistently stronger every game. Getting back to full fitness, playing well and then breaking down again is quite mentally draining but I''m doing all right at the moment.''
Wales next face Belgium, knowing that a win or draw would leave them brilliantly placed to qualify for a major championship since 1958.
Ramsey said: ''Belgium are a brilliant team with so many world-class players who can hurt you all over the pitch. You don''t become the second-best team in the world rankings for no reason.
''But we''ve had two good results against them away from home. We''ve had some good performances against them and we know what we''re about and what we''re up against. We''re confident, we''re at home and a sell-out for the first time in quite a while so it''s an exciting game to be involved in.''

At 6.30pm on Sunday, Sir Bradley Wiggins will climb on his bike in the London Velodrome and try to break cycling''s oldest and theoretically simplest record, riding flat out for an hour in an attempt to go further than anyone has before.
The hour record should need no further explanation. The fact that it does owes to cycling''s governing body, the UCI, tinkering with the rules in the late 1990s, when they banned some bikes and outlawed certain riding positions . . . after they had been used to break the record.
Thus, Chris Boardman''s 35.03miles (56.375km), set in 1996, is the furthest any cyclist has ridden in an hour, but it isn''t the mark that Wiggins will be trying to beat.


Instead it is the 32.89miles (52.937km), set in Manchester in late April by another British rider, Alex Dowsett, that stands as the official record.
Wiggins being Wiggins, however, he is looking beyond that — and he dreams of the distance covered by Boardman using the extreme and now banned ''Superman'' position.
''In my head, Chris still holds the record,'' said Wiggins this week as he looked ahead to what he says will be the first act in a three-part finale. The second will be the World Championships in London next March, with his farewell coming at the Rio Olympic Games. He insists, therefore, that Sunday will be his one and only attempt at the hour record. 


It was only in October that he began thinking about it, when the UCI decided on a clear set of rules for the hour. It inspired a glut of attempts.
Jens Voigt set a new mark, swiftly bettered by Matthias Brandle, then Rohan Dennis and Dowsett. There were also failed attempts along the way by Jack Bobridge and Thomas Dekker.
Wiggins has been training in Majorca, and it was there that he spoke to Boardman to seek his advice. He wanted to know: ''Am I an idiot for going for it?''


Boardman reassured him — ''He said it will either be the best thing I ever do or the worst thing.''
That aspect of the record is unchanged: there is no second prize, only success or failure. Some 6,000 fans — tickets sold out in 30 minutes — will be there to see Wiggins, and only Wiggins.
He will try not to think about that. ''It''s going to be different when the stadium''s full. It''s easy when the velodrome''s empty.
''In some ways I wish I''d done it behind closed doors. It''s a bit like a wedding. There are people you don''t want to invite but have to invite, and you end up in the last few days thinking, "We can''t have him sitting next to him because they''ll end up arguing".''  


He hopes to be inspired by the crowd but not too distracted from the task in hand, which is to ride the 250-metre laps in 16.2sec. And then repeat — about 220 times (he hopes).
Infamously, the hour record is a horrible undertaking — one that ex-holder Graeme Obree has compared to a near-death experience and a kind of ''man-made Everest'' that left the world''s greatest ever cyclist, Eddy Merckx, unable to walk for several days.
Yet Wiggins, as he looked ahead, did not seem like a man facing a brutal punishment. He was relaxed, happy and supremely confident that he will beat Dowsett''s mark, and perhaps get close to Boardman''s.
''If I could''ve spent my whole career doing this, I would,'' said the 2012 Tour de France winner. ''There''s nothing to worry about — is your team-mate going to attack or whatever . . . It''s so simple. It''s the purest form of cycling.''

Two-time Europa League-winning coach Unai Emery has distanced himself from a possible move to West Ham by committing his future to Sevilla until 2017.
The 43-year-old, who last month secured a second straight European title when Sevilla beat Dnipro in Warsaw, was reportedly the number-one candidate to replace Sam Allardyce at Upton Park but he has instead opted to oversee the Andalusians'' tilt at the Champions League.
A statement published on Sevilla''s official website on Friday read: ''Unai Emery has extended his contract with Sevilla for another season, thus prolonging his link with the Nervion club until 2017.
''The coach has committed his future to the Ramon Sanchez-Pizjuan, where he has achieved his greatest successes, winning the Europa League in both 2014 and 2015.''
Emery - previously employed by Spartak Moscow and before them Valencia - had also been linked to the vacancy at Serie A club Napoli that remains open following Rafael Benitez''s departure for Real Madrid.
Since arriving at Sevilla in January 2013 he has recorded two fifth-placed finishes in the Primera Division.
The Hondarribia-born tactician has taken charge of 142 games from the Rojiblanco dugout, a figure only surpassed by previous Sevilla bosses Ramon Encinas (179), Manolo Cardo (188) and Joaquin Caparros (226).

Champions League win can erase the years of pain

For Roy Hodgson, it was the sheer scale and sense of history oozing from Juventus which left the deepest impression.
For Liam Brady it was the style, standards and a little glamour. ‘Like Arsenal, they had a special way of doing things,’ said Brady.
‘They stood for tradition and class. They had the attachment to the Agnelli family who were like Italian aristocracy. They were the Old Lady of Italian football.
Scroll down for video 
‘They had fans all over Italy and a history of winning trophies. I remember asking a team-mate about bonuses for coming second and third and he said there are none. You have to finish first.’
And they did. Brady moved from Highbury to Juventus in 1980 and won Serie A twice. He was a darling of the Juventini and still is, having scored the penalty which clinched their 20th Scudetto despite knowing he was about to be sold to make way for Michel Platini.
England manager Hodgson coached rivals Inter Milan. ‘What struck me was the vast number of supporters’ clubs they had,’ said Hodgson. ‘Inter had thousands all round the country but Juventus had more. They were an institution with success comparable to Liverpool in their glory period or Manchester United more recently. They even survived after the calciopoli (match-fixing) scandal.’

Under Massimiliano Allegri, Juve have just won their fourth successive Scudetto, 17 points clear of Roma, and can equal an Italian record if they make it five. They also won the Italian Cup, completing their first Double since the days of the great Marcello Lippi. ‘Win the Scudetto? There’s the Champions League,’ Lippi said. ‘Win the Champions League? There’s the Inter-Continental Cup. Win the Inter-Continental Cup? There’s the Scudetto to win again. There’s little time for celebration.’
This quotation is writ large beside the glittering trophy room in the club’s J-Museum, and rings true as eyes turn to Berlin for Juve’s first European final in 12 years. 
‘The past is not forgotten in Italy,’ said Hodgson, familiar with grainy footage of John Charles or clips of Zinedine Zidane and Platini in the black-and-white kit originally modelled on the Notts County strip.
Most consider it a step too far to beat Barcelona but Juventus are proud of the depth of their desire and spirit. Former president Gianni Agnelli once said: ‘In difficult moments I appeal to something in my subconscious. The ability never to give in. This is why Juve win. Even when you do not expect it.’
Rivals may smile and mention power, corruption and scandal.
Ask a rival fan about this history of triumph against the odds and they will insist officials are swayed by the political influence of the Agnellis, original owners of the Fiat motor company.
Controversy has never been far from Juve’s door. There was a three-year trial into claims of doping covering a four-year period during the Lippi era (coach from 1994-99 and 2001-04).

The next big case, calciopoli, took Juventus down, literally.
General manager Luciano Moggi was found to have tried to influence the appointment of referees and Juve were relegated to Serie B and stripped of two Serie A titles (for 2005 and 2006).
Juventus always protested that the issue was an injustice based on jealousy and are still fighting for damages. But suspicion remains and Juve are still adored and detested in equal measure.
The Juventus Stadium, opened in 2011, is privately owned — a rarity in Italy — and generates huge match-day profits, giving Juve an edge at a time of financial fair play.
The 41,000-seat arena generates a vibrant atmosphere distinct from that of its soulless cavern of a predecessor, the Stadio delle Alpi. Plastered everywhere is the figure 33, the Serie A titles won — a total that includes the two lost to calciopoli.
Also representing the future is a name from the past. Andrea Agnelli, 39, was appointed president in 2010, the son of former president Umberto and a nephew of Gianni.
John Foot, author of Calcio: A History of Italian Football, said: ‘He has transformed the club. The stadium gave them a massive advantage and some of the signings have proved ridiculously good, like Paul Pogba and Andrea Pirlo. It’s not long since their marquee signing was Nicklas Bendtner.’
Perhaps the most inspired decision was to select Antonio Conte, captain under Lippi, as coach. Until leaving to manage Italy in 2014 Conte instilled traditional Juve values into a team with a solid defensive base.
‘That was always the style,’ said Brady. ‘Get the defence right and then have players who make the difference up front. We’re all looking at Messi but you never write off an Italian team in a final.’

Luis Figo may not have been involved after Barcelona''s sensational request to UEFA, but several other legends graced Berlin for a friendly game on the eve of the Champions League final.
A mixture of Juventus and Barcelona players formed a team to take on the world all-stars next to the Brandenburg Gate, though Figo was asked not to represent him as fans had still not forgiven him for leaving the club to join archrivals Real Madrid back in 2000.
But an eventful match still took place in front of around 1,000 fans, with Edwin van der Sar, Eric Abidal, Deco, Cafu and David Trezeguet among the players making an appearance in the Ultimate Champions Match.
JUVENTUS AND BARCELONA LEGENDS: Edwin van der Sar, Ciro Ferrara, Ludovic Giuly, Marcelo Salas, Fabrizio Ravanelli, Giovanni van Bronckhorst, Mark Iuliano, Edmilson, David Trezeguet, Mark van Bommel, Deco, Eric Abidal, Christian Vieri
WORLD ALL-STARS: Cafu, Robert Pires, Predrag Mijatovic, Davor Suker, Giovane Elber, Clarence Seedorf, Rai, Christian Karembeu, Steve McManaman, Pierre van Hooijdonk
 The Juventus and Barcelona legends were coached by Zico, and unsurprisingly many showed they were still fit as ever. Mark van Bommel, Giovanni van Bronckhorst and Alessandro Del Pierro all starred, while Deco was also in fine touch.
They were however beaten 14-12 by Peter Schmiechel and Ruud Gullit''s world all-stars, who had Davor Suker firing on all cylinders.
Steve McManaman, Robert Pires and Christian Karembeu also played, with the latter, a World Cup winner with France in 1998, having a go as a goalkeeper. 
A total of 25 Champions League winners medals were in action on the day, while the Blueman group entertained spectators prior to kick-off.
French striker Trezeguet, who scored a superb volley in the game, said: ''Some I have not seen for years, but of course it was wonderful. It was especially great to see the likes of Edwin (Van Der Sar) and Fabrizio (Ravanelli) again.''
And Ruud Gullit, coach of world-Allstars, said: ''If the guys also show such brilliant football at the finals, then we will see a spectacle.'' 
Fans at the Olympic Stadium will hope to be treated to another, though much bigger, spectacle on Saturday night as Barcelona take on Juventus.
Both sides are hoping to secure respective trebles, though Barca go into the game as favourites with Lionel Messi and Co on song.

Palmeiras midfielder Jorge Valdivia scored the only goal of the game as Chile edged El Savador 1-0 in a friendly match at the Estadio El Teniente Codelco in Rancagua.
The 31-year-old reacted quickest in the box to convert Jean Beausejour''s low driven cross from the left flank in the 14th minute. 
Despite close attempts from the likes of Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez and Hamburg''s Marcelo Diaz, Chile could not add to their lead. 
Still, 1-0 will do for the home side, who have notched their first victory following back-to-back defeats by Brazil and Iran. 
Chile boss Jorge Sampaoli started a strong team against El Salvador with Sanchez, Valdivia and Diaz joined by other big name players such as Gary Medel and Eduardo Vargas.  
However, Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal and Barcelona''s Claudio Bravo were absent owing to their clubs'' involvements in the Champions League final. 







Although Chile did dominate in Rancagua, they were somewhat lucky not to go behind. El Salvador nearly broke the deadlock through striker Nelson Bonilla in the eighth minute, but the 24-year-old mishit his shot under heavy pressure from Medel.
Chile kick off their Copa America campaign on Thursday against Ecuador. As tournament hosts this year, they will be hoping to win the competition for the very first time in their history.

‘I am enjoying it and hopefully I can continue to.
‘I feel settled. I’m looking forward now to playing and winning more trophies.

On June 7 last year England ground out a desperate 0-0 draw with Honduras in the final warm-up match before the start of the World Cup. Seven days later their world fell apart when England lost 2-1 against Italy. One year on, England must continue to use that disastrous tournament as a motivational tool.
Wayne Rooney has spoken about the anxiety kicking in when he closes in on Sir Bobby Charlton’s goalscoring record. He is three behind equalling him and it would be helpful if he could break it by the time England arrive at the Euros.
England are lining up some big games before the Euros, including prestige friendlies against France, Spain, Holland and Germany. It goes without saying that they will be a truer test of this team’s development before everyone starts predicting glory next summer.
England’s central defence caved in against Mario Balotelli and particularly Luis Suarez last summer. Hodgson is on the lookout for upgrades on Phil Jagielka, but Chris Smalling and Phil Jones are not the answer at the very highest level of the game.
Jordan Henderson spoke passionately and sensibly about England’s failings at the World Cup last summer. Now that the Liverpool midfielder is an established member of the group, it is time for him to exert more influence on this team. He can run that dressing room with Rooney.

Qualify, seemingly the outsider of trainer Aidan O’Brien’s three runners, flew through the final furlong to nail favourite Legatissimo and claim a shock 50-1 success in Friday''s Investec Oaks.
The short-head success of Colm O’Donoghue’s mount makes her the joint longest winner of the a race first run in 1779 alongside Jet Ski Lady (1991) and Vespa (1833).
In a rough race, Ryan Moore-ridden Legatissimo seemed home and hosed as she burst clear over a furlong out but O’Donoghue had Qualify rolling down the outside and she ran down the 5-2 favourite.
O’Brien appears to have a weaker hand than in recent seasons with his three runners – Giovanni Canaletto, Hans Holbein and Kilimanjaro - in this afternoon’ s Derby as he attempts to win the race for a fourth consecutive year.
But the Oaks result underlines that it is folly to ever write off Ireland’s dominant champion trainer.
Qualify was O’Brien’s fifth win in the Oaks and his second British Classic of the season having landed the 2,000 Guineas with Gleneagles.
O’Brien and his wife Anne-Marie also bred Qualify, who is one of the few horses in his Ballydoyle stable not owned by his Coolmore Stud backers.
The daughter of Fastnet Rock was sold to Chantal Regalado-Gonzalez and her husband John Murrell last year.
Despite her long odds, O’Brien insisted he had rated Qualify a contender with his decision to run her at last season’s Breeders’ Cup a reflection of his regard for the filly.
She had finished tailed off in the 1,000 Guineas and sixth in the Irish 1,000 Guineas, beaten just over six lengths, this season.
O’Brien said: ’She didn’t get a clear run at the Breeders’ Cup and the plan was to run in the two Guineas. The run at Newmarket went a bit wrong but she ran a really good race at the Curragh.
‘She finished really well off a very slow pace and one-one really noticed her. ’
O’Donoghue added: ‘ This is the highlight of my career. I’ve come second In a Derby (Treasure Beach in 2011) and I’ve won an Irish Derby (also on Treasure Beach) an Irish Oaks on Bracelet (2014).
‘I’ve been fortunate to ride around the world and have had some big winners but an Oaks is very special.’
Trainer David Wachman offered no excuses for Legatissimo, who is likely to drop back to a mile and a quarter, as could Luca Cumani’s third, Lady Of Dubai, who also enjoyed a clear run.
However, O’Brien’s fourth Diamondsandrubies was badly hampered when stablemate Together Forever lurched left, also taking out Star of Seville (ninth).
Frankie Dettori’s mount Jazzi Top was a never nearer fifth while Crystal Zvezda pulled too hard and looked all at sea on the track in finishing 10th of 11.

Swedish hopeful David Lingmerth leads an all-star field at the Memorial Tournament after shooting a flawless seven-under round of 65 on Friday.
The 27-year-old is yet to win on the PGA Tour but holds a one-shot advantage over 2013 PGA Championship winner Jason Dufner at the halfway stage in Ohio after finding seven birdies around the Muirfield Village course.
Adding gloss to a stellar performance was a three-foot birdie putt on the difficult par-four 18th hole that saw him post a 12-under total of 132.
Lingmerth - recently forced to regain his tour card at the Web.com Tour Finals after finishing 134th in last year''s FedExCup standings - told pgatour.com: ''All of a sudden I just started playing the way I know I can.''
Ohio-native Dufner, who made a hole-in-one with a six-iron on the 201-yard 16th having suffered a double-bogey on the par-three 12th, is just clear of the day''s biggest mover, Andy Sullivan of England.
The Nuneaton-born player is tied for third place with Ryan Moore after surging up the leaderboard with an eight-under 64. Twice a winner on the European Tour, he hit 16 of 18 greens, making eight birdies and no bogeys.
Tiger Woods, meanwhile, was just hoping to make the cut after following up his opening-day 73 with a 70 that featured five birdies and three bogeys.
Other stars struggling to make an impression included Justin Rose, who improved on his Thursday score of 68 by a single stroke, while joint overnight leader Hideki Matsuyama slipped into a five-way share of fifth place after reaching the clubhouse one under for the day.
Bo Van Pelt had matched the Japanese in carding a first-round 64 but returned to the course to shoot 72, thus tumbling to four strokes off the pace.
Elsewhere, recent Masters winner Jordan Spieth was grateful for three birdies and an eagle across eight holes as he managed to double-bogey the par-four 10th before bogeying the 12th.

Ipswich teenager Teddy Bishop has apologised after admitting to a charge of breaching the Football Association''s betting rules.
The 18-year-old midfielder was fined £3,000 and warned to his future conduct by a Football Association disciplinary hearing on Friday.
Bishop, who broke into the Ipswich first team this season, said he took full responsibility for the breaches, which are understood to have been at the lower end of the scale.


"It has been a very worrying time for me and I''d like to apologise to the manager and Ipswich Town," Bishop told the club''s official website.
"I have no one to blame but myself for not being fully aware of the restrictions in betting on football.
"I am only young and I''m learning all the time about experiences in life and in football. This is an experience I won''t forget. It has been a massive learning curve for me."


None of the bets placed by Bishop were on games involving Ipswich, while new rules regarding football betting came into force from August 1 last year.
The rules state that anyone involved in the sport at any level - from players and managers to match officials and club staff - is banned from betting on football, in any capacity, worldwide.
Participants covered by the ban are prohibited from betting, either directly or indirectly, on any football match or competition that takes place anywhere in the world. The ban was for bets on any football-related matter; from match outcomes, to the transfer of players, employment of managers or team selection.


The passing of inside information to somebody that uses that information for betting is also prohibited.
Ipswich''s managing director Ian Milne said: "Teddy has apologised to Mick McCarthy and the club for his actions.
"Like the rest of the playing squad and the club staff in general, he was made aware of the guidelines regarding betting on football matches at the start of the season.
"He has accepted his punishment and we have reiterated to him the responsibilities he has as an employee of Ipswich Town Football Club but it is worth noting that the bets were all for small amounts of money and while placed under Teddy''s name, were shared amongst his friends away from the game.
"He is young and has made a mistake. He is aware of that and will certainly learn from it."

Several white England kits will be available to pre-order on Wednesday, when Twickenham chiefs kick off the competition’s 100-day countdown.

A polyester replica shirt will retail for £70 with a classic cotton shirt available for £55.
Children’s shirts will cost £49.50 for a long-sleeved cotton version and £58.50 for a short-sleeved ‘Pro’ shirt.
The £120 version will be identical to those worn by Stuart Lancaster’s 31-man squad. Only a limited number — 2,015 — are available.
The Football Association charged £90 for a replica of England’s 2014 World Cup jersey and the backlash prompted David Cameron to urge a ‘rethink’ from price-setters.
Twickenham chiefs have already come under fire for releasing six different shirts in little more than 15 months, with two jerseys controversially featuring the Victoria Cross motif put on sale last September.

The organisation''s general manager Mike Riley said in a statement: ''PGMOL will always be grateful for the job Howard has done in promoting English refereeing over the last two decades.
''He was at the very forefront of our profession and has left a lasting legacy, inspiring a generation to take up the whistle.
''His unparalleled success on the field is matched by respect he has garnered representing refereeing off the pitch.
''I have enjoyed working with Howard during the last season and wish him every success in his new venture.''

Australia won the first Test in emphatic fashion when they beat West Indies by nine wickets late on the third day at Windsor Park in Dominica.
Australia mopped up their opponents by taking six wickets for 27 runs in the first 90 minutes of the third session to dismiss the hosts for 216 in their second innings.
That left Australia needing 47 runs to win and they knocked them off in five overs, only losing opener David Warner (28).
Steve Smith hit the winning run late in the day to avoid having to return on Saturday morning.
The second match in the two-test series will be played in Jamaica next week.
Apart from a fourth-wicket stand of 144 runs by Shane Dowrich (70) and Marlon Samuels (74), the second innings saw another wretched batting display by the home team, who made 148 in their first knock.
Australia''s left-arm fast bowler Mitchell Starc was the pick of their attack, collecting four wickets for 28 runs off 18 fiery overs.
He mopped up by snaring the final three wickets with the new ball, his pace too much for the tail enders to handle.
Left-arm quick Mitchell Johnson, right-arm fast bowler Josh Hazlewood and spinner Nathan Lyon all chipped in with two wickets a piece.
Lyon picked up his 141st test wicket, equalling Hugh Trumble as the all-time most successful off-spinner in Australian history.
Earlier, West Indies went for tea at 189 for four, at which stage they looked like setting Australia a decent challenge.
But they lost two wickets in four balls shortly after the interval, and once Australia had a chance to bowl at the tail with the new ball, the writing was on the wall.

The Football Association has charged Preston for the crowd trouble which followed their Sky Bet League One play-off semi-final victory over Chesterfield at Deepdale last month.
North End sealed their Wembley play-off final berth with a 3-0 victory over the Spireites on May 10 but there were ugly scenes during the pitch invasion to celebrate that achievement.
Chesterfield defender Ian Evatt, a previous employee of the Lilywhites'' rivals Blackpool, was assaulted by a 20-year-old apprentice mechanic who was later given a three-year ban from football.
The governing body has now alleged Preston failed to ensure spectators at the fixture ''refrained from provocative and/or abusive and/or threatening and/or violent behaviour'' and given the Championship newcomers until June 15 to respond.
Evatt had claimed he was punched, kicked and spat at during the pitch invasion and had suggested the FA take action against Preston to stop more violent scenes in the future.
Speaking to talkSPORT at the time, Evatt said: ''How long is it going to go on for until a player gets seriously injured? All it takes is one idiot with a knife or whatever else. It''s going to happen one day, until something is done about it.
''The only way people are going to learn is if the clubs get punished. I don''t want that but how else are fans going to learn not to go on the pitch? We can''t bring back the cages.
''There''s got to be a way round it so maybe it is time for the FA to stand up and start punishing people for doing it.
''I was terrified, I''m a big guy but in the changing room afterwards I was distraught because I have never been faced with such anger. It was scary, especially being on my own.''
During legal proceedings, a legal representative for Evatt''s attacker Matthew Edwards claimed he had not intended to go on to the pitch but changed his mind when he saw friends beckoning him to join the thousands who had invaded.
Fans had originally started to huddle down at the Deepdale advertising hoardings during the closing stages of the second leg when it became obvious North End were heading for their first Wembley appearance since 1994.
Multiple announcements were made over the speakers in the ground encouraging supporters not to enter the field of play, but these were not heeded and some fans had spilled onto the pitch when Jermaine Beckford scored an 87th-minute goal from the halfway line.

For all the rancour and revulsion that accompanied the staging of this game, purely in a football sense, Gordon Strachan will feel much the better for it.
This was never a night on which international reputations would be built or destroyed. One step up from a training game, this was all about the Scotland manager seeing some of his star performers shake off any staleness that’s crept in since the end of their respective domestic seasons.
Qatar made for decent if hardly dynamic opponents. Crucially for Strachan ahead of Dublin, they never lost sight of the friendly nature of the contest.

Booked: Abdullah, A El Sayed 
Attendance: 14,270 
Referee: Sebastien Delferiere (Belgium)
Aside from the odd bump and bruise, his squad will dust themselves down and go again for the game that really matters in its entirety.
If his side’s profligacy will be the main concern in the coming days, there were also positives to be had in most areas.
Matt Ritchie, the Bournemouth winger, claimed his first international goal in three outings shortly before the break and his case for inclusion is pressing.
Craig Forsyth, the Derby defender, produced a barnstorming display at left-back to lay a claim for a starting berth in the Aviva while the return of Charlie Mulgrew to the international fold was another boost.
All in all Strachan gave game time to 17 players and it’s indicative of the strength in depth that the names of the 11 who will take the field in Dublin remains the source of some debate.
With an epic clash in Dublin now hurtling into view, there was no question of Strachan being over-experimental with his line-up.
Charlie Mulgrew – man of the match at Celtic Park in November – was restored to the fold in central defence alongside Gordon Greer with Ikechi Anya and Craig Forsyth the unfamiliar faces in the full-back roles.
With James McArthur and Scott Brown in the engine room, James Forrest and Matt Ritchie were asked to provide the width for Shaun Maloney and Steven Naismith. Keeper David Marshall was one of five English Championship players given a much-needed run-out after a five-week break from competitive action.




For all the talk of protests over the choice of opposition, there was precious little evidence of it last night. The crowd inside Easter Road may have been modest but is was some way from embarrassing.
Forsyth, the Derby defender, showed no signs of ring-rust from his end-of-season hiatus with an explosive dart up the flank that immediately exposed the fragility of the visiting defence. Ritchie’s snap shot was blocked by an outstretched Qatari leg.
Ranked 99th in the world, Qatar evidently have some work to do if they are to be worthy hosts of the World Cup in 2022.
They largely relied on set-plays to trouble the Scots. Skipper Hassan Khalid H Alhaydos did sting Marshall’s palms with a meaty free-kick from distance after Brown had been harshly penalised but the Cardiff man watched it all the way.
Strachan will have been pleased with the manner in which his side manipulated the ball in tights areas. The inter-play between Maloney, Forrest and Naismith, in particular, will have had the Irish taking note.
Yet it was the driving runs of Forsyth down the left that were the most productive outlets. Naismith was next to benefit from one of his cut-backs, forcing Lecomte Claude Amine to produce a fine low save to his left.
The Everton man was foiled by the Qatari keeper again at the midway point in the first half after a fine pass by Forrest, with Amine this time flicking the ball from under his bar.
The traffic remained largely one-way. Anya ghosted off the right flank and arrowed a shot just wide of the far post, then Mulgrew glanced a header a yard wide from a corner.
Yet another Forsyth surge to the by-line invited Ritchie to try his luck on the volley but his effort was into the turf and, in any event, off target.
Maloney was next to hold his head in his hands. Sent clear on goal after a Qatari error, the Chicago Fire striker’s hopes of lashing home the opener were thwarted by a quite brilliant tackle by Ahmed Yasser M Abdelrhman.
Following a brief interruption to dispense with a professional attention seeker – also known as a streaker – Scotland claimed the goal their efforts in the opening 41 minutes had more than deserved.
Naismith drove from deep until his attempts to penetrate the Qatari box were blocked off by a roll call of defenders.
Ritchie motored onto the loose ball and claimed his first international goal with a clean strike into the bottom corner from 16 yards.
Naismith was a post’s width away from doubling the advantage on the cusp of half-time after McArthur’s clever ball over the top but Lady Luck again shunned him.
Craig Gordon and James Morrison replaced Marshall and McArthur respectively at the break, while Naismith’s frustrations in front of goal continued with a header and a shot into the side-netting.
Of far greater significance, however, was the fact he was able to get up and walk after a nasty looking collision with the Qatari keeper that had the Leith crowd momentarily fearing the worst.
Darren Fletcher, Leigh Griffiths and Charlie Adam were afforded just over half an hour, with Naismith, Brown and Maloney sacrificed.
In truth the score was something of a travesty. Forrest became the latest man in white to rue his poor finishing when he launched a Ritchie knock-down high over the top. The key area for improvement a week today is pretty obvious for all.
Qatar showed a little more ambition after the break. Indeed, were it not for a fine saving tackle by Anya, Abdelkarim Hassan A Fadlalla, their wandering left-back, would have levelled the score. Gordon denied the same man moments later with a smart block from close range.
The introduction of Johnny Russell for Forrest on 74 minutes was Strachan’s sixth swap of the night.
Russell was denied a second for the Scots by the giant arm of the Qatari keeper with the spadework on the flank coming from Morrison, while Griffiths had a late, late effort ruled out for offside.
Despite the lack of goals, it was not an exercise completely without its merits.

And Evra insisted that he''ll make sure Suarez knows he''s there when they do battle this weekend.
''I don''t want his apologies,'' Evra told ITV. ''It doesn''t matter, it''s no problem for me. But when we are going to play the game, I will shake his hand. He will never be my best friend, but this is not a problem.
''The past is the past. I am really proud of my colour and I will shake his hand like I did with Manchester when we play against Liverpool. My game is against Barcelona, it is not against Luis Suarez, but I will make sure he will feel me on the pitch.''
''I didn''t say to the judge [of the race row case] that Luis Suarez is a racist person,'' Evra continued. ''I just say in that moment he have some racist comment.
''I didn''t go there and say now "you have to punish him, he is a racist person". I don''t know that because I don''t know Luis Suarez very well to talk about it.
''But I controlled myself, I behaved myself, because in that moment I remember, it was like a voice inside my head – "don''t do nothing stupid, don''t do nothing stupid, don''t punch him or do something stupid because a lot of people are watching this game". For some kid, you have to show the example.
''If I do something wrong, maybe today I won''t be playing the final of the Champions League – I will get maybe a three-year ban or something like that. Sir Alex Ferguson after the game, and all my team-mates, they saw my face. I was in another galaxy in that moment.
''A lot of things were happening in my head. It was a really difficult day, but I was really proud of myself.''

Football Association chairman Greg Dyke believes departing FIFA president Sepp Blatter will not last long enough to implement reform and would not be surprised to see him arrested.
On Tuesday, just four days after being re-elected, Blatter announced he would be standing down in the wake of bribery and corruption charges which have brought the world governing body to its knees in the last few days.
However, in his announcement he pledged to stay on until a new successor was elected - not likely until December at the earliest - in order to drive ''far-reaching, fundamental reforms''.
Dyke believes that is highly unlikely.
''The great danger now is you get Blatter Mark II. That''s the danger,'' he said. ''It needs a root and branch change of the structure of the organisation. Blatter won''t lead that reform - he can''t do 
''And he''ll be gone. He won''t last. The one thing you discover if you run an organisation is that the moment you say you''re going, you''ve gone.''
Asked whether he would bet on Blatter being arrested if he had to choose, Dyke replied: ''Yes''.
He admitted suggestions England could step in to host the 2018 or 2022 World Cups, if corruption in the bid process was proved, were ''unhelpful'' and hoped a line could be drawn under future references.
''It looks like we''re doing it all for our own personal gain. We won''t have the World Cup in 2018, and we certainly won''t have it in 2022,'' added Dyke, who said the Qataris would ''sleep even less well'' after the FBI expanded its investigation to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.
''Already I''m sure there''s people in the FA saying, "Ooh he shouldn''t have said that, he shouldn''t have said this"'','' he said. 
''I''m certain there''s already people saying I shouldn''t have said anything about Qatar.
''There is no doubt that nobody can or will do anything against Qatar or Russia until the legal process is complete and unless there is evidence, laid bare, by some sort of investigative authority.
''But if it is there, if the evidence that these were awarded after a degree of corruption, clearly they''ve got to be revisited.''

Maggi brand image tarnished by Indian scare
Dramatic scenes emerged from India today (5 June) as television cameras showed rowdy consumers burning Nestle''s Maggi branded noodles in a bonfire.
Nestle has witnessed the rapid deterioration of consumer trust in the country as a food safety scare that started in the state of Uttar Pradesh spread throughout India.
The Food Safety and Drug Administration (FDA) in Uttar Pradesh claimed high lead levels were found during "routine tests" in two dozen packets of instant noodles. The state authorities also said they found the flavouring MSG, which must be labelled if it is used in production.
State governments throughout the country then began carrying out tests of their own. According to the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, a further two states have also confirmed the presence of lead and MSG in samples collected.
While Nestle has repeatedly insisted Maggi is safe – and apparently questioned the validity of the state''s tests behind closed doors in discussions with the FSSAI – the immediate impact on Nestle''s reputation in India has been startling.
"Detection of lead in a food product as a heavy metal contaminant beyond permissible levels renders the food product unsafe and hazardous," the FSSAI insisted today. The body required Nestle to pull all nine varieties of Maggi noodles from the shelves.
In fact, Nestle had already initiated a voluntary recall. The company conceded consumer trust has been dented and said it is pulling products from the shelves until the "confusion" surrounding Maggi''s safety can be clarified.
"The trust of our consumers and the safety of our products is our first priority. Unfortunately, recent developments and unfounded concerns about the product have led to an environment of confusion for the consumer, to such an extent that we have decided to withdraw the product off the shelves, despite the product being safe," the company said in a statement. "We promise that the trusted Maggi noodles will be back in the market as soon as the current situation is clarified."
Speaking during a press conference in India, CEO Paul Bulcke – who has flown in to try to contain the situation – reiterated his belief Maggi noodles are safe. The issue, he suggested, was one of communication – with both the authorities and consumers.
The fact Bulcke has swept in to contain the damage speaks to how seriously Nestle is taking the situation. He insisted Nestle remains committed to India, highlighting how the company has operated in the market for a considerable period of time. "Nestle has been in India for 100 years. Nestle is part of India," he told reporters.
Nestle said it was "too early" to comment on what impact the scandal and recall will have on sales in the market. According to MainFirst analyst Alain Oberhuber, Maggi sales comprise around 29% of Nestle sales in India. The loss of this revenue stream would represent a "significant hit" to Nestle in the country.
Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox believes the issue could affect Nestle''s total organic growth in the current quarter. "India is a small part of group sales... [but] India is a major growth driver (particularly given weakness elsewhere in BRICs and emerging markets) and we presume the issue could knock ten to 20 basis points from Nestle’s organic sales growth in Q2, which we already expected to be a somewhat soft quarter," he wrote in an investor note.
The issue could also prove detrimental to Nestle''s broader strategy in the Indian market. According to Euromonitor International analyst Lianne van den Bos, India is an important country for Nestle''s Maggi brand, representing its second-largest market with retail revenue of US$263m.
"Nestle’s strategy in India has been to provide affordable products that cater to a wide consumer base (including tier three and four cities). By building a strong image in an affordable product such as noodles, Nestle has been able to broaden the Maggi brand’s remit, and extend into products with higher margins such as cooking sauces and meal solutions for the more affluent consumers. This strategy has, however, been dependent on the trust that consumers have in Maggi and this is what is at risk," van den Bos noted.
Another risk factor for Nestle is the scandal could spill over into other international markets. Singapore has already moved to block the sale of noodles imported to the market from India while the UK has confirmed it is testing Maggi noodles for lead and MSG.
Nevertheless, commentators by and large believe the issue will be a short-term bump in the road for Nestle. Pundits have highlighted Nestle''s strong food safety and compliance record, on the one hand, and the short memories of consumers, on the other.
As van den Bos summed up: "This scandal is very damaging for Nestle in the short run as it affects its whole business strategy in India. It should be pointed out, however, that Maggi has been around for a very long time in India and food scandals are frequent in the Indian market. It will not be long until another comes along and distracts consumers (and the media) from the Maggi food scandal of 2015."

Maggi noodles withdrawn, Nestle still insists they are safe
Nestle has been forced to withdraw its Maggi noodle brand in India over a scare that has seen local food safety bodies insisting that the product is tainted with elevated levels of lead and MSG.
The company said today (5 June) that it has taken Maggie noodles off the shelves despite insisting that the products are "safe".
"The trust of our consumers and the safety of our products is our first priority. Unfortunately, recent developments and unfounded concerns about the product have led to an environment of confusion for the consumer, to such an extent that we have decided to withdraw the product off the shelves, despite the product being safe," the company said in a statement. "We promise that the trusted Maggi noodles will be back in the market as soon as the current situation is clarified."
The scandal, which broke in Uttar Pradesh after the authorities detected elevated lead and MSG in routine testing, has seen a number of Indian states ban the sale of Maggi noodles. States that have banned Maggi include: Delhi, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttarakhand. Retailers such as Future Group''s Big Bazaar, Wal Mart and Metro have also reportedly pulled Maggi noodles from the shelves. UP has filed a criminal case against Nestle India while other states continue to test products.
Nestle''s own testing as well as sampling commissioned by the company and carried out by an independent laboratory found amounts of lead "well within" levels permitted by regulatory standards, Nestle said. The company also insisted that it does not use the ingredient MSG in Maggi noodles in India.
Maggi noodles account for 29% of Nestle India sales.

FrieslandCampina is to reduce up to 375 roles at two sites in The Netherlands as it tries to improve efficiency.
FrieslandCampina is looking to cut up to 375 roles across two of its sites in the Netherlands in a bid to improve efficiency.
The Dutch dairy processor said it has "invested heavily in greater production capacity, quality improvements and safety at production facilities" at its sites in Beilen and Leeuwarden and as part of a move toward reducing costs and increasing efficiency, it is cutting jobs at both sites over the next three years.
Between 210 and 230 jobs could go at Beilen, out of a workforce of 767 over the next three years. The site produces infant nutrition and ingredients. At Leeuwarden, which produces condensed milk for export to the Middle East, Africa and Asia, approximately 125 to 145 jobs will go.
FrieslandCampina said affected employees with permanent employment contracts would be covered by its "social plan as in force at that time". The plan helps employees that have lost their jobs find new work.
"The current social plan expires this year and is no longer in keeping with the situation at FrieslandCampina. The number of locations has continued to decline in recent years, as a result of which there will be less scope for redeployment within the organisation. FrieslandCampina therefore intends to adjust its social plan, and it will discuss this matter with the trade unions," the company added.

Hook: Newburn Bakehouse "strategically more important" to Warburtons amid competition
Warburtons, the UK baker, continues to enjoy growth from its free-from unit Newburn Bakehouse as demand for gluten-free bakery products in the UK continues to rise. However, competition is intensifying. Dean Best spoke to Warburtons'' free-from director Chris Hook at the Free From Food Expo in Barcelona, to find out more about the group''s plans - not just in the UK but, potentially, elsewhere in Europe.
Business at privately-owned UK baker Warburtons is dominated by conventional bakery but the company is putting increasing efforts behind its free-from unit Newburn Bakehouse.
Free-from accounts for a small part of the group - around 2-3% of its annual sales - but, with the conventional bakery category one of the toughest in the country, free from is growing in importance at the company.
Competition in mainstream UK bakery is acute, with the category one of the sectors central to price competition among the major retailers. Some of the country''s supermarket chains have also been reviewing a number of categories, including bread, as they look to streamline ranges in response to the success of the discounters. In March, it emerged Tesco, which has been cutting SKUs, had delisted bread brand Kingsmill, owned by Associated British Foods.
Conventional bread is a tough place to do business in the UK and, to varying degrees, all of the major brands are being affected. Against that backdrop, the biggest brands are devoting more attention to other segments, such as wraps, thins and, in Warburtons'' case, free-from.
"I think it''s fair to say in terms of the way the main board are viewing free from, it is becoming a more important leg strategically within the business," Chris Hook, Warburtons'' free-from director, tells just-food.
Hook says Warburtons is set to invest in its production at its dedicated free-from bakery in north-east England. The plan, he explains, is to increase the plant''s "flexibility", partly with an eye on potentially taking the Newburn Bakehouse brand into other markets in Europe. Alongside finding "the right distribution partners", Hook says investment in production and packaging is vital for Newburn Bakehouse''s ambitions outside the UK.
"There''s some investment going on currently in the bakery where we''ll be looking to upscale and invest further in the kit we are using so we can start to add longer-shelf life products to the portfolio, which will enable us to venture into mainland Europe and also just into Ireland."
There are possible avenues for brands like Newburn Bakehouse in Europe, where there is growth but where markets are less developed than the UK.
Hook is optimistic about the opportunities. "I think there''s a frustrated demand in Europe," he says on the sidelines of the Free From Food Expo in Barcelona. "I''ve picked up, not just last year but this year, a frustration from European retailers that they want to embrace this opportunity and provide a range of products. To date, they''ve tended to default to the principal brand - which is Schar - and I know they want to broaden the portfolio and the choice for consumers, which they are not necessarily always getting from Schar. That''s one of the key opportunities for the likes of us, [Boulder Brands-owned] Udi''s and Genius Foods to bring interesting products into Europe."
Warburtons could have Newburn Bakehouse products ready to launch into other European markets in 12 months. "I''d like to think by May, June 2016 we''ll have a portfolio of products that are fit for purpose for the European market. In principle, Ireland is a key market for us going forward but we''re also acutely aware that the Italian market is one of the biggest markets and we really want to explore that opportunity. And then the German territory."
A launch of Newburn Bakehouse into overseas markets would not be the first time Warburtons has made a foray outside the UK. However, the group has not found its international ventures plain sailing, with unsuccessful moves for conventional Warburtons products in France and central Europe in recent years.
Nevertheless, Hook says Newburn Bakehouse has the freedom to look at new markets. "Warburtons have been into Europe and then retreated from Europe and have really consolidated in the UK. The free-from business at Warburtons does have a licence to explore other channels. By using the brand Newburn Bakhouse by Warburtons, we feel that''s an ideal vehicle to explore what is fundamentally a different market. The free-from market is a different market to core bakery. We do have a licence to pursue that but we''ve got to have the right product format, that''s key for us."
The UK gluten-free category - and the bakery segment within that - continues to grow at a healthy rate. Hook says Newburn Bakehouse''s sales grew 11% last year. However, in an echo of what is being seen in conventional bakery, competition in gluten-free is heating up.
He concedes competition in gluten free in the UK is creating "some pressure" on price but says the still relatively small size of the category and the fact consumers are ready to buy "brands they trust" protects prices. "There is some pressure but fundamentally it''s still a market that will justify the current price structure. The volumes are still not at a level you''d expect with a mainstream product. The cost of manufacturing, the cost of ingredients are still high. And what we''re finding very clearly is consumers are prepared to pay more for quality. To have a product that tastes as good as a mainstream product, people will pay for that."
In the UK, looking at the free-from category as a whole, Newburn Bakehouse "held its own" last year, Hook says, "hovering around 22-23% in terms of the total bakery category". However, he adds: "In terms of bread, we''d not where we''d like to be. We realise that Genius do hold the number one position there. While that doesn''t sit comfortably with us, we appreciate they were first to market. We are looking at more innovative ways to be products to market that will challenge Genius and give the retail customer and the end-consumer a better quality product."
In April, Warburtons added "artisan", hand-made loaves to its Newburn Bakehouse range. The company launched two SKUs - a standard, white loaf and a white sourdough loaf - into Sainsbury''s and Hook says it plans to extend the line. "We''re looking to expand that range and take the quality level up to a different point so you''ve got a real premium product. I''d like to be in a position where I''m sat down with the Warburtons family where it''s hard to tell the difference between a Warburtons white loaf and one of our artisan, gluten-free loaves from Newburn Bakehouse."
Warburtons is also looking to emphasise what it sees as the health credentials of its gluten-free products versus rival bread. On the Newburn Bakehouse website, in a claim dated to January, the company says its seeded farmhouse loaf has "40% lower fat than Genius’ loaf" per 100g.
"Health is going to become paramount to success within the free-from category," Hook says. First and foremost, you need to be gluten-free, wheat-free and ideally dairy-free. Then you need to look at your health claims. You need to look at new ingredients, new processes to embrace healthier claims because that''s where the real growth is going to come from in terms of lifestylers. Lifestylers are looking at these products in the first instance believing they''re healthier for them but then they look at the back of pack and they realise the fat content is especially high or the sugar content is high and so, on second reading, it''s not as healthy as they first suspected. There are two key drivers for free from - one is quality and the second is the health benefits."
Hook declines to reveal Newburn Bakehouse''s sales figures and, as a privately-owned business, Warburtons is not bound by the reporting requirements of listed groups, making it hard to a make a calculation of the brand''s recent sales. In the last set of accounts released to Companies House, Warburtons'' company turnover was GBP562.1m (US$860.2m) for the 52 weeks to 28 September 2013.
While the Newburn Bakehouse business generates 2-3% of Warburtons'' sales, Hook forecasts it could grow to 5-6% of group turnover by 2019.
Despite increased competition in UK gluten-free bakery, there is, then, optimism of continued growth at Newburn Bakehouse domestically - and fledgling ambitions for a move into Europe.

Nestle has reduced the salt content in its frozen pizza range
Nestle has announced two changes in the last week to try and boost sales of its frozen business in the US. Both moves play into rising consumer trends of healthier eating and convenience. But with Nestle''s frozen business still reeling from the effects of a consumer shift towards fresh due to perceptions of it having greater goodness, are the moves enough to win consumers back? Hannah Abdulla explores.
In the last week, Nestle announced two step changes which affect its US frozen food portfolio, pointing to suggestions the Swiss food-maker is desperately seeking out damage control options for this pressured category.
Frozen has been the laggard for Nestle for some time now. However, the chill is being felt right across the frozen category in the US. According to data from Euromonitor International, frozen processed food experienced slow growth in the years 2013-2014 of US$40.65bn to $41.99bn. In frozen pizza specifically, sales increased to $5.2bn versus $5.01bn for the same period a year earlier and in frozen ready meals, sales grew marginally to $8.33bn from $8.27bn.
It is undoubtedly a problematic situation for Nestle and the Stouffer''s owner appears torn over how to react. Nestle is the largest player in US frozen, with sales of $394m, two-and-a-half times bigger than the nearest rival. It is unsurprising it is not in a hurry to ditch its frozen business and has appeared committed to trying to "fix" the problems it is facing in frozen.
One of the brands experiencing a tough time is its frozen diet brand, Lean Cuisine. At an investor day last June, Nestle said it was preparing to step-up investment in the brand. One could argue, where Lean Cuisine is concerned, the coolness is coming from it being a "diet" brand. Frozen diet meals, according to Nielsen data, have seen a fall in value of 7% to $2.1bn.
But Nestle''s problems in frozen go well beyond just one brand. In its full year results, announced in February 2014, Nestle said while it had seen good performances in coffee creamers, super premium ice cream and PetCare in North America, growth was offset "by the continuing contraction of the frozen category". In frozen pizza it said "category dynamics" in addition to pricing "led to a disappointing slowdown".
The company is, however, still working on solutions. This week Nestle made two announcements which will impact its frozen foods business.
The first of the two changes saw Nestle commit to removing artificial flavours and cutting salt from the pizzas and snacks it sells in the US. The level of salt will be reduced by 10% compared to the amount in the products in 2013. The move will impact over 250 frozen products.
It is not the first time Nestle has made such a move . Earlier in the year, it announced it was pulling artificial flavours and colours from chocolate products in the US in response to growing demand for clean label and more natural products. But this is the first such move in its frozen business and the commitment appears to be one way of trying to amend the way consumers perceive "frozen". In recent years, frozen has been viewed by many consumers as not having the same levels of goodness associated with fresh.
CEO Paul Bulcke, during the full year investor conference call, alluded to the fact Nestle would be working to change negative perceptions that had been built towards the frozen category.
"Frozen is not perceived fresh, although it has all the intrinsic freshness in there... [there is] fundamental work to be done, something we started already one-to-two years ago. It is linked with the quality and the freshness of the products, with the ingredients we put in there. It is also going for the intrinsic quality of the category, and that''s why we have this campaign, Freshly Made, Simply Frozen," he said.
Jon Cox, analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux, says this latest move from Nestle in shouting about the health benefits through salt reduction is important for the Di Giorno owner. "Frozen is seen as long shelf life - meaning full of unhealthy things to enhance shelf life, which turns consumers off despite the convenience of the product. Nestle has to move in this direction, remove anything seen as bad and highlight the naturalness and goodness of the products in addition to the convenience."
In keeping with the push toward better-for-you the company today (5 June) announced the launch of a new range of "protein-packed" frozen meals under its Stouffer''s brand. Fit-Kitchen targets Americans that "strive to eat healthier and be healthier" suggesting Nestle is really trying to shift perceptions of being an unhealthy frozen foods maker.
The second of its big moves in frozen this week focused on convenience. In a bid to grow its presence in the snacks category, Nestle launched bite-sized versions of its Hot Pockets products. The company is selling Hot Pockets Snack Bites and Hot Pockets Breakfast Bites to tap into the fragmentation of meal times.
Again, this is not a knee-jerk reaction from Nestle. At the full year results Bulcke noted that Nestle needed to move toward the "way people want to eat" which is "more healthy snacking throughout the day".
Christopher Brody, marketing manager for Hot Pockets added: "Today''s millennials aren’t sitting down to a traditional three meals a day, so the lines have become blurry between meals and snacking."
Similarly the truth of the matter is not everyone has time to cook from scratch. Such a product offers a higher level of convenience, and with Nestle''s latest commitment to cut salt, signifies the firm cares about consumer health.
"When it comes to some of its frozen offerings, namely frozen pizza, savoury snacks and ready meals, the convenience angle is a given but it has to show and persuade consumers that it is taking their concerns about overly processed foods seriously," says Cox.
Whether these moves to improve the health of its frozen portfolio are enough to drag the category out of the mud are only something time will tell. But its safe to assume for many of the brands within frozen, this really is last-chance saloon.
At the Consumer Analyst Group of Europe, the-then CFO of Nestle, Wan Ling Martello indicated the firm had limited patience for its US frozen business.
"We''re very clear on which ones to fix quickly, if not to divest and which ones do we need to accelerate and in what brackets. We have a very clear roadmap internally," she said.
And while it has accelerated moves in fixing certain aspects of frozen, Cox believes internally, Nestle has issued a strict timeframe as to when such moves should start boosting numbers.
"I suspect that it has given local managers until the end of the year that it''s relaunch is working - otherwise you may find parts of the business are sold off," he concludes.

Warburtons to invest in production for possible European push

He indicated the company was eyeing Ireland, Italy and Germany and was optimistic about the opportunity to exploit growing demand for more gluten-free products in Europe as the category grows.

UK confirms testing Maggi products 
The UK''s food safety watchdog confirmed today (5 June) it is testing samples of Maggi noodles for lead after a food safety scare forced Nestle to issue a recall in India.
Indian food safety authorities insist that have detected levels of lead in Maggi noodles that exceed prescribed limits. For its part, Nestle claims the noodles are safe and that its own independent tests found lead within allowable levels.
Nestle has questioned the testing protocols employed by Indian state authorities. However, the stance was rejected by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, which described Nestle''s argument as "not... tenable".
The row has taken on a global dimension, first with food safety regulators in Singapore banning the sale of Maggi noodles imported from India and now with the UK''s Food Standards Agency launching its own investigation into the safety of the product.
A spokesperson for the FSA told just-food: "The FSA has taken the decision to test for levels of lead in Maggi Noodles as a precaution, following the incident in India... We are currently working with Nestle and the European Commission to investigate a report of higher than expected levels of lead and undeclared MSG in Maggi noodles."
The FSA said Nestle''s UK arm only imports one flavour of Maggi 2 Minute Noodles from India – the masala variety. "The batch of noodles originally tested by the authorities in India was not sold in the UK. Other flavour Maggi noodles are not imported from India but from other Nestle factories in other countries," the FSA spokesperson noted.

Maggi scare goes global as Singapore bans some sales
Singapore''s food safety authority has banned the sale of Nestle Maggi noodles that are imported to the market from India.
The Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA) advised importers to suspend the sale of Maggi brand instant noodles produced in India. The AVA has taken samples of the instant noodles for food safety tests and advised affected importers to withhold sales until tests are completed.
A spokesperson for Nestle''s Malaysian arm said the "majority" of Maggi noodles on sale in Singapore are manufactured in Malaysia.
The spokesperson said: "We import a small amount of Maggi Noodles from India for only one store, Mustafa, and have since removed the products from the shelves even though they are tested and found to be in compliance with local laws and regulations and safe for consumption."
Nestle''s unit in Singapore will continue to monitor and test for lead as part of its "stringent quality control process", the spokesperson continued.
"All Maggi Nnodles are manufactured under stringent manufacturing conditions that meet both local and international standards and are safe for consumption."
Nestle has been forced to remove its Maggi noodle brand from Indian shelves after local food safety regulators said they detected elevated levels of lead and MSG. The company has repeatedly insisted its products are safe for consumption and said it had issued the recall due to "consumer confusion" over the situation.

FSSAI says Maggi contains lead
India''s food safety regulator, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, has described Nestle''s argument Maggi noodles are safe as "not... tenable".
According to the FSSAI, tests conducted by three Indian states have detected amounts of lead that exceed permissible levels under the country''s food safety regulations. Authorities in Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Tamil Nadu all confirmed elevated lead levels in Maggi noodles, the FSSAI said today (5 June).
In a meeting with the FSSAI, Nestle executives argued testing protocols "had not been followed and interpreted correctly". The company suggested the dried noodles and seasoning should not have been tested individually but should have been tested as a combined end product. Moreover, the samples collected in Uttar Pradesh were tested as a combined end product but, Nestle suggested, the sample had "remained open for a considerable period" thus tainting the result.
However, the FSSAI rejected these arguments on the basis the seasoning and noodles are packaged separately and should therefore be tested separately. The authority also insisted no samples were tainted: "It is wrong to say that the sample remained in open condition for about two months".
The FSSAI said: "Detection of lead in a food product as a heavy metal contaminant beyond permissible levels renders the food product unsafe and hazardous." The body required Nestle to pull all nine varieties of Maggi noodles from the shelves.
The FSSAI also insisted Nestle''s labelling of products as containing "no added MSG" was "misleading" because, although the food giant does not use MSG as an ingredient, naturally occurring glutimate is present in Maggi noodles.
In addition, the FSSAI was critical of Nestle for launching its Maggi Oats Masala Noodles with Tastemaker product "without getting the product assessed for its risk / safety and grant product approval".
The FSSAI said Nestle believed the product was launched at a time when an advisory requiring approval was under stay granted by an Indian court. However, the regulator said the product was exempt from this rule because it is a "propriety food".
The FSSAI ordered Nestle to withdraw the Maggi brand and "stop further production, processing, import, distribution and sale of the said product with immediate effect".
Earlier in the day, Nestle had said it is removing Maggi from shelves in India due to consumer confusion. The company said: "The trust of our consumers and the safety of our products is our first priority. Unfortunately, recent developments and unfounded concerns about the product have led to an environment of confusion for the consumer, to such an extent that we have decided to withdraw the product off the shelves, despite the product being safe. We promise that the trusted Maggi noodles will be back in the market as soon as the current situation is clarified."
Speaking during a press conference, Nestle CEO Paul Bulcke was quick to stress the firm is "working with the authorities" to ensure compliance. While Bulcke stressed his belief Maggi noodles are "safe", he insisted the consumer is the company''s "number one priority".

Swedish health and wellness group Midsona has announced the acquisition of Danish organic food maker Urtekram.

Nestle has launched the new Fit Kitchen line as part of the Stouffer''s range.
Nestle is adding a range of new "healthier" products under its frozen Stouffer''s brand.
Stouffer''s Fit Kitchen are "delicious, wholesome and contemporary frozen meals packed with protein," the company said in a statement.
Each Stouffer''s Fit Kitchen meal offers 25g of protein.
The line was launched in response to "a huge gap in offerings in the frozen aisle for men". Consumer research from Stouffer''s showed "many men don''t feel there are enough nutritious and satisfying meal options available in the frozen aisle."
"Stouffer''s understands that many Americans strive to eat healthier and be healthier," said Rhonda Richardson, nutrition communication manager at Nestlé. "Fit Kitchen can help get you on the right track to a healthier life through a protein-packed, well-portioned meal."
Fit Kitchen offers a range of six frozen meals and is available nation-wide in the frozen aisle, at a suggested retail price of US$3.99
This June, STOUFFER’S®, provider of premium-quality frozen entrees, is launching STOUFFER’S® Fit Kitchen —delicious, wholesome and contemporary frozen meals. Packed with protein and modern flavors, Fit Kitchen meals provide an answer to a void in the freezer aisle - a hearty, satisfying meal that consumers can feel good about enjoying. Each Stouffer’s Fit Kitchen meal offers 25 or more grams of protein, paired with complex carbohydrates and crisp vegetables, delivering meals bursting with flavor.
This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here:http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150604005761/en/
This new sub-line has been years in the making, after STOUFFER’S identified a huge gap in offerings in the frozen aisle for men, with men eating 13 billion home alone dinners and spending 36 billion dollars a year on these eating occasions1. But consumer research2 conducted by STOUFFER’S showed that many men don’t feel as though there are enough nutritious and satisfying meal options available in the frozen aisle.
“As a dad myself, I was a part of this demographic who really felt like there were a lack of options that catered to what I was looking for on nights when I needed a solo dinner,” said Tom Moe, the director of marketing at STOUFFER''S. “We challenged ourselves to come up with a product men will not only feel good about eating, but that will also provide protein that leaves you satisfied, and bring bold, delicious flavors to the table. We feel STOUFFER’S Fit Kitchen delivers just that.”
Fit Kitchen offers six protein-packed meal options made with mouthwatering flavors and whole food ingredients:
STEAK FAJITA in smoked red chile sauce with a mix of red & green peppers and seasoned brown rice
CILANTRO LIME CHICKEN white meat chicken with a black bean & corn mix, seasoned brown rice and a verde tomatillo sauce
ROTISSERIE SEASONED TURKEY with a mix of diced red skin sweet potatoes & green beans
MONTEREY CHICKEN with diced red skin & sweet potatoes, lightly buttered green beans with BBQ style sauce
BOURBON STEAK with chipotle mashed sweet potatoes, seasoned broccoli & red peppers
OVEN ROASTED CHICKEN with diced red skin potatoes, seasoned broccoli and a savory wine sauce
While never lacking on modern flavors, these new recipes were created with nutrition in mind – from using healthier cooking methods, like grilling or oven-roasting, to using herbs instead of oil to season and bring a burst of flavor.
“STOUFFER’s understands that many Americans strive to eat healthier and be healthier,” said Rhonda Richardson, nutrition communication manager at Nestlé. “Fit Kitchen can help get you on the right track to a healthier life through a protein-packed, well-portioned meal.”
True to all STOUFFER’S products, Fit Kitchen uses quality ingredients in every meal and prepares them similar to how consumers would prepare them at home in their own kitchen. From the diced sweet potatoes, to the red and green peppers, Stouffer’s picks their vegetables at the peak of perfection.
Fit Kitchen is an easy and convenient way to enjoy a protein-packed, delicious meal in a snap.
STOUFFER’S® Fit Kitchen is available nation-wide in the frozen aisle, at a suggested retail price of $3.99. For more information on Fit Kitchen, visit stouffers.com/fit-kitchen or follow @Stouffers for more info.

Kettle maker Diamond narrows guidance 
US snack group Diamond Foods this week reported its third-quarter results and issued an upbeat outlook thanks to a strong domestic performance from Kettle. UK firm The Real Good Food Co. indicated it is considering acquisition opportunities following its disposal of sugar arm Napier Brown. Elsewhere, Grupo Nutresa reported a positive start to the year. Here are this week''s results in brief.
Diamond Foods raises guidance
US snack maker Diamond Foods narrowed and lifted its earnings full-year guidance this week after booking higher third-quarter EBITDA.
Adjusted operating profit in the three months to 30 April rose 27% to US$30m. Net earnings increased to $25.1m, versus a $162.8m loss in the year ago period. The company said it expects full year earnings to total $118-123m, slightly up on the prior guidance range of $117-123m.
Sales in the period were down 2.5% to $186.1m but margins improved as the company exited lower margin revenue streams. Gross margin stood at 28.5%, up from 23.6%.
BB&T Capital markets analyst Brett Hundley said the snack maker''s performance was lifted by Kettle in the US, but noted the group''s brands in the UK were hit by high levels of trade promotion. Hundley wrote: "Kettle US performed ahead of expectations, and its Diamond of California brand held up better in the face of price increases taken previously. Going forward, it expects conditions for its Kettle UK business to improve in Q2'' 2015/16, and it is planning for the continuation of heightened promo activity in popcorn."

Real Good Food Co. on acquisition trail
UK group The Real Good Food Co. indicated it will deploy the proceeds from the sale of its Napier Brown sugar unit to step up investment in its remaining businesses, including possible acquisitions.
Chairman Pieter Totté said: "Now that the disposal of Napier Brown has been completed, we can focus on developing our other businesses, all of which present growth opportunities... Our strong cash position will enable us to pursue capital investment plans to support our growth strategies, and we will also consider complementary acquisitions where appropriate."
The disposal of Napier Brown generated a consideration of GBP34m (US$52m), plus estimated working capital at completion of GBP7m, resulting in a positive cash position at completion of around GBP13.7m, the company revealed.
Real Good Food Co. said for the year to the end of March net sales are expected to be approximately GBP104m and EBITDA in the order of GBP5.3m. The group is due to release full-year numbers next month.

Grupo Nutresa sees "very positive sales"
Colombian chocolate company Grupo Nutresa said that sales increased 12.8% in the first quarter to the end of March, rising to COP1.7trn. Organic growth stood at 10.5%, the company revealed.
International sales, however, where 9% down year-on-year. The company attributed the drop to the Venezuelan exchange rate impact.
The group''s operating profit was slightly higher on the year, increasing to COP198.5m from COP195.6m. Net income totalled COP151.1m versus COP159.6 due to the impact of discontinued operations.

Calovo Growers back in the black
Calovo Growers reported a profitable first half, with higher sales and earnings prompting the US group to suggest it is gaining "momentum".
Operating earnings increased to $21.2m, up from a loss of $1.1m in the first six months of last year. Net profit rose to $13.7 versus a loss of $212,000. Sales were also higher, increasing to $416.3m from $363m.
CEO Lee Cole said: "We gained operating and financial momentum in each of our business segments last quarter. All factors aligned, enabling Calavo to register this outstanding, record-setting quarterly performance".

Sophie Tranchell, CEO, Divine Chocolate
This week, Nestle said it was withdrawing its Maggi noodle brand in India after a food safety scare that has seen local authorities insist the product has elevated levels of lead. Elsewhere, Abbott Laboratories was tied up in a class action lawsuit over its Similac product with allegations it is misleading consumers since the product contains non-organic ingredients. Elsewhere Nomad Holdings confirmed it is in acquisition talks with Findus Group. just-food visited the Free-From Expo in Barcelona this week and spoke to Warburtons among others. We also interviewed the CEO at Divine Chocolate. Here is the week in quotes
"If there is a real crisis in cocoa then it’s going to be problematic for everybody... The emphasis that we have been making is that it is incumbent on the chocolate industry to make cocoa farming worthwhile. Cocoa farmers need to earn a better income so that the next generation takes it up... The rest of the chocolate industry has been very concerned about there not being enough cocoa going forward and their focus has been increasing yield – but this is not necessarily increasing farmer income" - Sophie Tranchell, CEO at Divine Chocolate, discusses how Divine''s farmer ownership strategy allows for a more "secure supply chain".
"I think there''s a frustrated demand in Europe. Also I''ve picked up, not just last year but this year, a frustration from European retailers that they want to embrace this opportunity and provide a range of products" - Chris Hook, Warburtons'' free-from director, tells just-food at this year''s Free-From Expo Warburtons is weighing up taking its free-from brand Newburn Bakehouse into Europe. 
The trust of our consumers and the safety of our products is our first priority. Unfortunately, recent developments and unfounded concerns about the product have led to an environment of confusion for the consumer, to such an extent that we have decided to withdraw the product off the shelves, despite the product being safe" - Nestle withdraws its Maggi noodle brand in India over a scare that has seen local food safety bodies insist the product has elevated levels of lead.
"The ... investors and companies recognise that protecting forests and upholding human rights are essential for long-term business models and, consequently, investments that depend on a resilient, sustainable natural capital base" - Food makers including Kellogg, PepsiCo and Mars call on the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil to "strengthen transparency, auditing and enforcement" among its members.
"The total exports to Russia should not be affected due to the embargo and will continue to be performed by five other units in the Marfrig Beef in Brazil and four units in Uruguay, therefore there will be no impact in terms of volume and profitability" - Marfrig responds after Russia blocks meat imports from one of its plants along with three other Brazilian companies.
"Obesity is a complex problem which cannot be reduced to the demonisation of one ingredient, nor can it be right that an everyday ingredient such as sugar is characterised as a poison" - Ian Wright, the UK Food and Drink Federation''s director general, responds to comments made by the National Health Service chief, Simon Stevens, that the food industry should "stop marketing junk food at children" and step up its efforts to remove sugar from processed foods.
"We feel relieved that there are no casualties amongst our employees. However, this day will remain a dark page in the history of Lotus Bakeries" - Jan Boone, CEO of Lotus Bakeries, on news a fire has "completely destroyed" its production facility in Meise.
"Abbott deceptively and misleadingly claimed that the infant formula is ''organic'' and charged a premium price for the ''organic'' infant formula. Abbott was also motivated to mislead consumers to take away market share from competing products, thereby increasing its own sales and profits"- A class action lawsuit has been filed against Abbott Laboratories over its Similac infant formula that alleges the US group is "misleading" consumers since the product contains non-organic ingredients.
"While frozen food is regarded as a cash generator, it is also characterised by low margins. Due to storage concerns, frozen food is primarily sold in big chained retailers and discounters which typically own their own private label, exerting significant pressure on the margins of branded products. The high cost, low margin nature of the category lends itself well to private equity, where aggressive cost cutting measures can rapidly improve profitability"- Euromonitor analyst Pinar Hosafci says the frozen category is well-suited to the cost-cutting nature of private equity investors as news breaks that Nomad Holdings is in talks to acquire Findus Group.
"By enhancing the product line up with the addition of Japanese-style ramen and other new frozen noodles, Ajinomoto intends to rapidly expand its entire frozen foods business" - Ajinomoto says it is looking at accelerated expansion of its frozen food business in North America and is building a frozen noodle plant in the US.

Smucker''s food margins improve
US coffee-to-condiments group JM Smucker booked a drop in full-year profits today (4 June) as issues at its coffee unit overshadowed higher operating profit in consumer food.
The company said net earnings fell 39% to US$344.9m. Operating income declined 16% to $919m. The drop can be attributed to problems in the group''s retail coffee business. US retail consumer food operating profit increased 10% from 2014, climbing to $393m in the year to 30 April.
CEO Richard Smucker commented: "While these results were significantly impacted by the challenges in our US retail coffee segment, we are optimistic about our current initiatives and confident in the long-term prospects of our coffee business."

Group sales were up 1%, climbing to $5.69bn. Adjusted for factors such as M&A and currency exchange, group sales dropped 3%. Consumer food sales were also down 3% to $2.1bn.

Danone''s Brookside has acquired Sameer Agriculture and Livestock Limited.

Danone-backed Kenyan dairy company Brookside Dairy has acquired Ugandan dairy company Sameer Agriculture and Livestock Limited.
SALL produces a range of dairy products including fresh and UHT milk, yoghurt, butter, ghee and milk powder, Danone told just-food. The company sells in its domestic market and exports to Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Mauritius and South Sudan.
Danone acquired a 40% stake in Brookside last July.
"With Brookside, Danone thus has a strong base to develop dairy products in east Africa. Brookside operates a unique distribution platform enabling a daily access to over 200,000 outlets; the company manages the largest milk collection network in East Africa, with 140,000 farmers in the region," it said.
Danone declined to disclose financial details of the deal with Sameer but it was reportedly worth around KES3.5bn (US$36m).

Findus, Nomad have started due diligence 
Since Nomad Holdings announced it had acquired European frozen food firm Iglo Group, the market has been waiting for the investment firm''s next deal to help its ambition of building a portfolio of "best-in-class" FMCG brands. Nomad confirmed yesterday (4 June) it is in "exclusive" negotiations over the acquisition of assets of Findus Group. The acquisition would strengthen Iglo''s hand in the European frozen food sector but, in order to seal the deal, Nomad could have to pay the piper, Katy Askew suggests.
When Nomad announced its acquisition of Iglo Group in April, the company said it "seeks to build a portfolio of best-in-class companies and brands". This, Nomad continued, will be achieved through Iglo''s organic growth as well as M&A. "Nomad will pursue strategic and complementary acquisitions intended to enhance its consumer offering and deepen its market leadership," Nomad explained.
As M&A specialists Oghma Partners noted in their review of M&A activity at the start of 2015, the GBP1.9bn (US$2.9bn) sale of Iglo left the frozen food unit positioned as a consolidator in the European frozen food space. "There are indications that Nomad is looking to find bolt-on acquisitions for Iglo. With 90% of the frozen food market to go for in Europe, the next few years could see Iglo acting as a leading consolidator in the sector," Oghma said.
Certainly, there are a number of post-Iglo acquisition targets that could pique Nomad''s interest. Glenboden M&A expert Stephan Kirk argued that there are "plenty of candidates" for Nomad to pursue in our recent M&A Watch column. Potential targets could include Kerry Group''s frozen ready meals business in the UK or Hortex in Poland. The "big one" for Iglo, however, is Findus Group, Kirk argued in April.
Indeed, Nomad confirmed yesterday (4 June) that it has entered "exclusive" talks with Findus owner Lion Capital over the purchase of the group''s continental European assets and the Findus brand.
"Nomad confirms that it is in exclusive early stage discussions with Findus to acquire its continental Europe business and the Findus brand," Nomad said in a regulatory filing.
A spokesperson for the investment vehicle declined to comment beyond the official statement.
For its part, Findus revealed today due diligence is "currently taking place". The company detailed the scope of discussions, which include Findus Nordic (including Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark) and Findus southern Europe (including France, Spain and Belgium). The talks do not, however, include Young’s Seafood Ltd, Findus Group’s fish and seafood company in the UK.
Expanding Iglo''s geographic reach is likely to be a key priority for Nomad. Findus'' strong presence in southern European and Nordic countries would complement Iglo''s own geographic footprint and augment its operations in markets where the business does not currently have a strong market share.
Building scale in the frozen food sector is also likely to be key to Nomad''s business model. Frozen food is typically a strongly cash generative business but one where margin pressure is intense. For this reason, Euromonitor analyst Pinar Hosafci says, the category is well-suited to the cost-cutting nature of private equity investors.
"While frozen food is regarded as a cash generator, it is also characterised by low margins. Due to storage concerns, frozen food is primarily sold in big chained retailers and discounters which typically own their own private label, exerting significant pressure on the margins of branded products. The high cost, low margin nature of the category lends itself well to private equity, where aggressive cost cutting measures can rapidly improve profitability," Hosafci notes.
The acquisition of Findus would extend Iglo''s leading share of European frozen sales. Euromonitor data suggests Iglo had a 10.3% market share in 2014, while Findus was Europe''s third-largest frozen food maker behind Oetker Groupe with a 4.4% share of sales.
A combined Iglo-Findus could leverage this scale to reduce costs and drive synergies, advancing the firm''s competitive position.
While the strategic logic behind a tie-up between Iglo and Findus is strong, both Findus and Nomad were quick to stress that a deal is far from secured. In the fragmented European frozen food sector, it seems unlikely that competition issues will block a deal altogether. So, it is likely to come down to a question of price.
According to one industry source, Nomad could end up paying quite a premium if it is to ink a deal. "With a strong IPO market at the moment and improved quoted food ratings they may have to pay above 9 times EBITDA to get it."

Ramen-style noodles Ajinomoto already sells in the US
Japanese food group Ajinomoto intends to "accelerate the expansion of its frozen food business in North America" and is investing JPY3bn (US$25m) to open a frozen noodle plant in the US.
Ajinomoto operates a joint venture with Toyo Suisan Kaisha to supply frozen noodles to the North American markets. The company, which acquired ethnic food maker Windsor Quality Holdings last year, said that the frozen noodles would be fed into its North American operating unit, Ajinomoto Windsor Inc (AWI).
"Ajinomoto will bring together the high-level noodle manufacturing technology of Toyo Suisan Kaisha, the production technology of Ajinomoto Frozen Foods Co., and the product development technology of AWI to provide the North American market with high-quality frozen noodles with specialty backed by technology," Ajinomoto said in a statement.
Ajinomoto observed that demand for Japanese-style ramen noodles is "booming" in North America and added that the market for frozen noodles is witnessing "double-digit growth". By extending its frozen food product portfolio to include frozen noodles, Ajinomoto expects to step-up the growth rate of its frozen food operations.
"The current line up of Asian frozen foods centres on products such as gyoza, spring rolls and fried rice. By enhancing the product line up with the addition of Japanese-style ramen and other new frozen noodles, Ajinomoto intends to rapidly expand its entire frozen foods business through the powerful sales network of AWI, which covers all of North America."
The facility will have an annual capacity of 8,600 tonnes. Construction is scheduled for completion in June 2016 and the company expects to begin production at the site the following month.

The  UK NHS chief said the food industry should "stop marketing junk food at children".
The Food and Drink Federation has hit back at comments from the UK National Health Service chief suggesting that the food industry should "stop marketing junk food at children" and step up its efforts to remove sugar from processed foods.
In an interview with The Times, NHS boss Simon Stevens appeared to back sugar taxes, calling for a "change in the weather and terms of trade" around the food industry. He highlighted that one child in ten is obese on starting primary school and one in five is too fat when they leave.
"The task of the food industry and the retailers is to reformulate food – particularly sugar – as they have done on salt, and to recognise that they don’t want to end up on the wrong side of the public argument," he said.
The FDF''s director general, Ian Wright, in an open letter addressing Stevens'' comments said: "Obesity is a complex problem which cannot be reduced to the demonisation of one ingredient, nor can it be right that an everyday ingredient such as sugar is characterised as a poison."
The letter pointed out how FDF members have for many years "taken a responsible, proactive and collaborative approach to public health," naming Mondelez, Premier Foods and Unilever all as examples that have made changes to improve some of their foodstuffs.
"We have reduced calories through recipe reformulations, including sugar and saturated fat reductions, to iconic products and changed portion sizes. In particular, through the use of low calorie sweeteners, significant reformulations have been made in carbonated beverages, dairy desserts and yoghurt, confectionery and table-top sweeteners.
"We support evidence and science-based solutions in tackling the obesity challenge. Indeed when it comes to taking action on health, companies rely on government guidance to ensure they are focusing their energies and investment in work which will bring about positive change for consumer health. This is why it is so important to us that the science is used accurately, and not casually overstated. That will only confuse the consumer," Wright added.

Legendary fashion designer Christian Dior exploded onto the Paris fashion scene post-World War II. His signature designs of full skirts, ankle-length dresses cinched in at the waist, and sloping shoulders flew in the face of wartime restrictions, as he reintroduced femininity and luxury back into the fashion market.
WATCH: FashionTV Live 24/7 >>> Click here!
Today, Dior’s legacy is carried forward under the creative direction of Raf Simons, who joined the French fashion house in April 2012 and had just eight weeks to create his first collection – and that, was a Haute Couture collection!

Since the arrival of Simons, the Belgian fashion designer has brought a modern and reworked edge to Dior’s classic shapes that have been praised and admired by fashion editors, celebrities and fashionistas around the world. Last month, Dior and I, was released — a new fashion documentary by Frederic Tcheng, which offers a peek into the atelier of Christian Dior and follows the introduction of Simons to the fashion house.

Yet, every woman dreams of owning a Dior item in her closet, and some, are lucky enough to! Among those, are classically beautiful actresses such as Natalie Portman, who is the face of Miss Dior; Marion Cotillard, the face of Lady Dior handbags; and Jennifer Lawrence —who wore that Dior Haute Couture gown when she fell down the stairs to collect her Oscar in 2013. Most recently, Rihanna has been named as the first black woman to front a Dior campaign; the singer will star in the fourth installment of the label''s Secret Garden campaign, shot by Steven Klein in Versailles.

This weekend, FashionTV presents ‘The Story of Kate Moss.’ Tune in: May 8-10!
Kate Moss was famously discovered at the age of 14 at JFK Airport in New York, and quickly became a pioneer of the heroin-chic look. Now, a style icon for generations, Kate is the rock ‘n’ rebel model that has worked with the industry''s greatest fashion photographers, brands and beauty teams; and at 41, her model career is anything but slowing down. Here’s a sneak peek at things to come this weekend. See it first on FashionTV.
WATCH: FashionTV LIVE 24/7 Online >>> Click here!
From walking on the world’s greatest catwalks to bringing the fabulous to the front-row, Kate Moss is a Burberry favorite both on-and-off the stage. Recently, she landed the ‘My Burberry’ fragrance campaign with younger star Brit, Cara Delevingne. FashionTV was at the Burberry Spring 2015 London show where we caught up with the talented two.

As well as having supermodel, fashion designer, editor, muse and style icon on her resume, Kate Moss was the sole star of the White Stripes music video, for their cover of 1960’s classic, “I just don’t know what to do with myself.” The black-and-white clip, directed by Sofia Coppola, sees Kate giving the pole her ultimate strip tease dance.

Forty is the new 30! And no one proved it better than Kate Moss, who helped Playboy celebrate their 60th anniversary issue, and her 40th birthday, dressed in classic Playboy bunny attire.

Kate Moss made her mark on the editorial world, with an issue of British Vogue that she helped put together, properly themed, ‘Kate’s World.’ From dressing and organising forty people for a single shot with Tim Walker, to turning David Bailey''s legendary lens onto her favourite boys, Moss shares the stories behind this special issue.

Injecting new ideas to to Fall/Winter 2014-15 with his first collection as Artistic Director at Louis Vuitton, Nicolas Ghesquière reveals his designer inspiration. “I approached Louis Vuitton like a wardrobe. I think it should be really something effortless. Some clothes that are really easy to grab and wear, and when I started to work on the collection, I didn’t want it to make a strong statement or anything like that . . . I wanted to get really close to how people dress today.”

Chosen as the fresh faced beauty of the Louis Vuitton Lockit bag, Hollywood actress Michelle Williams reveals her true delicateness in the 2014 advertising campaign... “It’s like falling in love.”

Tune in: April 3-5!
Tom Ford was born in Texas in 1961, and later moved to New York to pursue his dream in art. He partied with Andy Warhol at Studio 54, and later dropped out of college to work as an actor in California. After saving money from his acting stint, Ford decided to pursue a degree in architecture which he soon changed to fashion. And so the rise of Tom Ford began.

Upon graduation, Ford began working for Cathy Hardwick, followed by Remy Ellis, helmed at the time by Marc Jacobs, and then the designer’s career with Gucci began -- by 1999 helping the brand to make $4.3 billion! After Gucci Group bought Yves Saint Laurent, Ford was assigned to the position of creative and communications director in addition to his Gucci role.

It was in 2004, that the Tom Ford brand was launched. He also has his own film company FADE TO BLACK, which released the well received film “A Single Man” in 2009. In 2010, Ford marked his return to womenswear, with Beyonce, Emma Stone, and Gwyneth Paltrow among his celebrity fanbase. Other moments of marvel include Jay-Z dedicating an entire song to the designer on his “Magna Carta Holy Grail” album as well as collaborating with Justin Timberlake on his Suit & Tie cover art and music video, in 2013.

OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The Cleveland Cavaliers finished off Chicago and swept past Atlanta, even when Kyrie Irving wasn''t available.
Now they have to find their way past the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals without him.
Irving has a fractured left kneecap and will have surgery that could sideline him for three to four months, the Cavaliers said Friday.
Already without Kevin Love, the Cavaliers are now without their All-Star point guard, who had been playing in pain for most of the postseason and was injured again in the final minutes of Game 1 on Thursday night.
''''As far as how we prepare, we''ve been through this. We''ve played games without Kevin, without Kyrie,'''' coach David Blatt said Friday, before the team announced Irving''s diagnosis. ''''We know how we want to play when they''re not in there. From that standpoint, we can prepare. Our main concern right now though is just Kyrie''s health. That''s all.''''
The Cavaliers said an MRI exam Friday at Stanford Sports Medicine Clinic revealed the injury and that surgery will be performed at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland by Cavaliers head team physician Dr. Richard Parker.
''''Saddened by the way I had to go out but it doesn''t take away from being (a part) of a special playoff run with my brothers,'''' Irving wrote in a Twitter posting. ''''Truly means a lot for all the support and love. I Gave it everything I had and have no regrets. I love this game no matter what and I''ll be back soon.''''
Irving limped off the court during overtime of Cleveland''s 108-100 loss on Thursday night and left the arena on crutches. He has been bothered by foot and then knee pain for most of his first postseason, sitting out the second half of the series-clinching victory over Chicago in the second round.
He then missed two games during the Eastern Conference finals, but played well Thursday, finishing with 23 points before leaving with 2 minutes left in the extra period.
Matthew Dellavedova stepped in during Irving''s absence in the last round but played only 9 scoreless minutes Thursday.
LeBron James said Friday the Cavs would be prepared no matter who was available.
''''Well, there are a few things that you would love to have going late in the season,'''' he said. ''''That''s being healthy, having a great rhythm, and then you need a little luck as well. We''ve had a great rhythm. We haven''t had much luck, and we haven''t been healthy. But I haven''t gotten discouraged.
''''I understand the moment that I''m in, and I''m not too much worried about the game. I''m worried about the moment. I''m happy with the moment. I''m excited to be in this moment once again, and I''m going to stay strong for my team, no matter who is or is not in the lineup.''''
The Cavs have battled injuries throughout James'' first season back in Cleveland. Starting forward Anderson Varejao was lost to a ruptured left Achilles tendon months ago, then Love''s dislocated left shoulder came as the Cavs were finishing a first-round sweep of Boston.
Now they are without one of the league''s dynamic performers, who had posted the NBA''s two highest-scoring games this season with 57 and 55 points, against a team that Warriors already had a decided advantage in depth.
''''Well, Golden State has a very deep roster that''s been one of their strengths throughout the season.  We''ve been a team that''s been struck with injuries that has shortened ours to a certain extent,'''' Blatt said. ''''I think we did pretty good coming through that. We''re here in the NBA Finals. But certainly their depth is something that has to be reckoned with, and it''s a factor for them.''''
Still, the Warriors insisted it wouldn''t make things easier as they chase their first title in 40 years.
''''So we can''t assume that Kyrie plays or doesn''t play that it''s going to be a cakewalk for us to get a championship,'''' Warriors star Stephen Curry said. ''''It''s still going to be a challenge. It''s still going to be tough. We have to control what we control and do what we do.''''
James scored 44 points Thursday, his most ever in the finals. He''s dealt with having important teammates hurting in the finals, from the Cavs shutting down Larry Hughes midway through the 2007 series to Dwyane Wade''s leg injuries last season.
He said the good thing now is the Cavs were already used to playing without Irving.
''''So, next man up,'''' he said, ''''and guys will be ready for the challenge.''''

PHOENIX (AP) -- Brittney Griner filed for an annulment with Glory Johnson-Griner on Friday, a day after Johnson-Griner announced she''s pregnant and a month after the two WNBA players were married.
''''Last Wednesday, Glory and I agreed to either legally separate, get divorced, or annul our marriage, Griner said in a statement. ''''I can confirm that today I filed for an annulment. In the week prior to the wedding, I attempted to postpone the wedding several times until I completed counseling, but I still went through with it. I now realize that was a mistake.''''
Griner, the 6-foot-8 Phoenix Mercury star, married Johnson-Griner on May 9, three weeks after they were arrested in Arizona on domestic violence charges for a fight at their home in suburban Phoenix. Both players were suspended seven games after their arrests and Griner agreed to undergo 26 weeks of domestic violence counseling as part of a plea agreement.
Both players apologized for the incident and said they worked out their differences, saying they were happy about the marriage. Johnson-Griner, a two-time All-Star with the Tulsa Shock, announced on Instagram on Thursday that she was pregnant and would miss the WNBA season.
Earlier Friday, a post on Johnson-Griner''s Instagram account showed a photo of Griner and a message about seeing her again: ''''One day until I''m reunited with my Wife (at)brittneygriner . . . This is about to be one CRAZY SUMMER!!!''''
Griner has appealed her suspension and Johnson-Griner''s will not start until the 2016 season because she will not play this season.
Griner was the WNBA''s defensive player of the year and helped the Mercury win the league championship last season.
The WNBA season started Friday night, with the Mercury opening defense of their title at home against the San Antonio Stars.

AMSTERDAM (AP) -- The United States had been 0-4 against the Netherlands and had just given up a pair of second-half goals, keeping up the pattern of defensive mistakes that has plagued the Americans since last year''s World Cup.
Then the U.S. bounced back - in stunning fashion.
The Americans rallied to beat the Dutch 4-3 in an exhibition on Friday night, giving coach Jurgen Klinsmann another milestone following the Americans'' first victory against Italy and first win at Mexico.
Danny Williams got the tying goal in the 88th minute and Bobby Wood scored 96 seconds later, the first international goal for each. Both were part of a lineup filled with second-half substitutes.
''''I was just kind of in shock,'''' Wood said.
Klaas-Jan Huntelaar split the central defenders and scored on headers in the 27th and 49th minutes and assisted on Memphis Depay''s 53rd-minute goal as the sixth-ranked Netherlands built a 3-1 lead.
Gyasi Zardes got his first international goal in the 33rd for the U.S., which reached halftime in a 1-1 tie despite having just 39 percent possession.
Wood (22), Zardes (23) and Williams (26) all failed to make last year''s World Cup roster but could play a role next month at the CONCACAF Gold Cup, where the Americans hope to successfully defend their title and earn a berth in the 2017 Confederations Cup. The U.S. has another test Wednesday when it plays world champion Germany in Cologne.
''''We can now counter those heavy legs that maybe some players develop after 55, 60, 65 minutes,'''' Klinsmann said. ''''That might be the difference to a year ago. We can now counter that with players that come off the bench that actually can surprise people with speed. And speed plays a big role in the modern game.''''
John Brooks, a 22-year-old defender whose late goal lifted the U.S. over Ghana in the Americans'' World Cup opener, cut the U.S. deficit to 3-2 in the 70th minute. He stripped Huntelaar of the ball just shy of midfield, passed to U.S. captain Michael Bradley and kept on running. Bradley sent the ball wide to DeAndre Yedlin, who centered for Brooks to tap in from 6 yards for his second international goal.
Williams tied the score when Luuk De Jong headed the ball weakly following Bradley''s corner kick. Williams intercepted the clearance, and his 20-yard right-footed shot deflected in off De Jong''s outstretched left foot and the underside of the crossbar.
DeJong had two great chances following the kickoff, with Brad Guzan saving an 8-yard header and DeJong knocking the rebound off the crossbar. Bradley then eluded three defenders during a 50-yard run upfield and passed ahead to Jordan Morris. The Stanford sophomore centered for Wood, who swept the ball in with his right foot from 7 yards.
''''I was lucky that my shot deflected at the end,'''' said Williams, who plays for second-tier Reading in England. ''''It''s an absolutely fantastic feeling to win against Holland in Amsterdam.''''
Wood, whose Erzgebirge Aue club was relegated to the German third division, was making just his seventh appearance for the U.S.
''''It kind of made me mentally stronger,'''' Wood said of the unsuccessful relegation fight. ''''It''s something that every player kind of has to go through. I''m happy that after that hard time I had this good time.''''
The Americans, ranked 27th, had been outscored 7-1 by the Dutch. In 11 matches since the World Cup, the U.S. had outscored opponents 12-4 in the first half of matches, then been outscored 12-3 in the second.
U.S. captain Clint Dempsey stayed in Seattle to await the birth of his fourth child. Fellow attacker Jozy Altidore is recovering from a hamstring injury and midfielder Alejandro Bedoya was out with a knee injury and watched from the stands.
Guzan, who lost his starting job at Aston Villa in April, made his first national team appearance since November and has been announced as the U.S. starter at the Gold Cup.
''''It gives us that belief that when we do play tough teams, when we do play big teams, especially in difficult venues, away from home, outside the United States, that we can go and get wins,'''' he said.
NOTES: Huntelaar''s goals raised his total to 41 in 72 international matches, moving one ahead of Patrick Kluivert for second place on the Dutch scoring list. Dutch captain Robin van Persie leads with 49. ... The Dutch play a European Championship qualifier at Latvia next Friday and are third in Group A after five matches.

DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) -- David Lingmerth took a step toward turning his game around with a 7-under 65 at the Memorial on Friday. It gave the Swede a one-shot lead going into a weekend that includes Tiger Woods.
But just barely.
Long after Lingmerth capped off a bogey-free round at Muirfield Village, Woods was 40 yards away from the flag on the 18th green and in dire need of getting up-and-down to save par and avoid missing his first cut at the tournament he has won five times.
For his second straight tournament, he holed a key putt to survive.
''''At least I was able to make those putts, so that''s a positive sign,'''' Woods said after his 2-under 70. ''''Now I just need to put myself in the position where those putts are to win tournaments, not to make cuts.''''
He was 11 shots behind Lingmerth, who was at 12-under 132.
Woods had to hang on, making two straight bogeys before his par save on the final hole. For Jason Dufner, it was a thrill a minute.
Dufner made a 5 on a par 3 and a 3 on a par 5. And that was before he made a hole-in-one - his fourth eagle of the week - on the par-3 16th hole. He followed that with a bogey. It was relatively boring after that, and the former PGA champion wound up with a 67 that put him in final group with Lingmerth, just one shot behind.
Dufner didn''t have much to say - he rarely does, even when he won the PGA Championship two years ago - and spoke only to Ohio-based reporters. Until a tie for eighth last week at the AT&T Byron National, he had gone just over a year without a top 10 on American soil. The only time he made news was when his divorce was reported.
''''I''m hitting it really good,'''' Dufner said. ''''I''m having enough good holes, good shots, to offset some of the mistakes I''ve had.''''
Ryan Moore, gearing up for a U.S. Open near his hometown outside Tacoma, Washington, had another 67 and was at 10-under 134, along with Andy Sullivan of England, who can earn a spot at Chambers Bay with a good week at the Memorial.
A trio of past champions - Hideki Matsuyama, Jim Furyk and Justin Rose - were in the group that was three shots behind. Joining them was Patrick Rodgers, who made eight birdies in a round of 66 and is poised to at least secure temporary membership on the PGA Tour.
Good scores were stacked up behind them. There were plenty of birdies available on a course that still presents trouble around every corner.
''''Every shot gets your attention,'''' Rose said.
It got the attention of Masters champion Jordan Spieth. He went out in 31 and was creeping up on the lead when he wound up on the wrong side of the 10th green and made double bogey, and he never recovered. Spieth missed a half-dozen putts from 10 feet or in and had to settle for a 70 that put him six shots behind.
Phil Mickelson made a late eagle for a 68 and was in the group at 4-under 140.
Kenny Perry made bogey on his last hole for a 73 and missed the cut by one shot. The 54-year-old took a career money exemption for the year so he could end his career at the Memorial, which he won two times.
Lingmerth had missed four cuts in his last five starts, and the start of this tournament was ominous when he was 2 over through four holes. He made seven birdies on his last 12 holes on Thursday, and he made seven more Friday.
''''I started giving myself some opportunities and the putts started dropping in,'''' Lingmerth said.
Dufner was tied for the lead late Thursday until he hit his tee shot into the water on the 18th and made double bogey.
He started Friday on the back nine and was in trouble early when he hit into the water on the par-3 12th and had to make a 4-footer to salvage double bogey. His fortunes changed quickly. He hit a wedge to 5 feet for birdie on the 14th. He hit hybrid into 6 feet for eagle on the 15th. And then he hit 6-iron into the hole on the par-3 16th.
Five under on three holes goes a long way.
''''Probably the best I''ve ever done,'''' Dufner said.
Woods, meanwhile, opened with three birdies in four holes, though he was still wild off the tee. He mixed bogeys with birdies and was in reasonable shape at 3 under for the tournament until he missed the 16th green long and made bogey, and then found a deep patch of rough just off the left side of the fairway at the 17th, had to lay up and could get no closer than 30 feet from 100 yards. That bogey put him on the cut line, and he popped up his 3-wood off the 18th tee into rough.
But he saved his par and saved his weekend.
This is the third straight tournament that Woods made the cut, something he hasn''t done in a year. He believes he is making progress, though the bar has been lowered significantly at the moment.

CLEVELAND (AP) -- Major League Baseball upheld Baltimore Orioles pitcher Brian Matusz''s eight-game suspension for having a foreign substance on his arm during a game.
The Orioles got some good news Friday, too. They are getting back star catcher Matt Wieters after he missed more than a year for elbow surgery. He was activated from the 60-day disabled list and is in the lineup against Cleveland.
The Orioles made a flurry of roster moves after Matusz''s suspension was upheld.
''''The idea is to penalize the team by suspending him for eight games,'''' manager Buck Showalter said. ''''They''ve obviously done that because we had to make a lot of moves to offset it.''''
Matusz will begin serving the suspension immediately. The left-hander was ejected from a game May 23 against Miami when umpires discovered the substance on his right forearm. He was suspended Monday and is eligible to return June 14.
Matusz will work out at the Orioles'' spring training headquarters in Sarasota, Fla. during his suspension.
Milwaukee Brewers left-hander Will Smith''s suspension for the same infraction was reduced Friday from eight games to six.
Wieters, a three-time All-Star, is set to bat fifth against the Indians. The switch-hitter is playing for the first time since May 10, 2014. He had Tommy John surgery five weeks later.
''''My sole thought all along was to keep working as hard as I could to come back,'''' Wieters said. ''''Whether it took one year or five years, I didn''t care.''''
Wieters is happy to be part of the team again.
''''I''m sure that I''ll have some nerves, but that''s fine,'''' he said. ''''What I''m looking forward to the most is just being at the ballpark, having normal days again.''''
Showalter said the plan for now is Wieters will catch every other day.
Catcher Steve Clevenger and right-hander Mike Wright were optioned to Triple-A Norfolk while infielder Everth Cabrera was designated for assignment.
Infielder Rey Navarro was recalled from Norfolk. The contract of left-hander Cesar Cabral was selected from Norfolk

CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina and the NCAA appear to agree on at least one thing: The school has corrected problems that led to its long-running academic fraud scandal through numerous reforms and personnel changes.
What the two sides don''t agree on is what rule violations were committed.
That will play a role in any potential sanctions the school could face now that the NCAA has hit the school with five charges, meaning there''s still a long road to resolution in a nearly 4-year-old case.
''''We''ll do everything we can do to make it go as quickly as possible, but we''ll take the time to do it thoughtfully,'''' UNC chancellor Carol Folt said Friday. ''''But I think we all know that we will get to the end of this process. And I''m very anxious for that to take place because while this has been going on for all these years, we''ve been doing so many other things.''''
The NCAA''s notice of allegations outlined a lack of institutional control and four other potential Level I violations, which are described as a ''''severe breach of conduct.''''
The NCAA regarded issues surrounding academic irregularities within the formerly named African and Afro-American Studies (AFAM) department as potential improper benefits by saying athletes received ''''special arrangements'''' such as access to courses and other assistance generally unavailable to non-athletes.
The lack of institutional control focused on the AFAM department and the academic support program for athletes, including the conduct of a women''s basketball adviser for providing too much help on assignments. No coaches were charged.
Many details followed findings from the eight-month investigation by former U.S. Justice Department official Kenneth Wainstein. His probe found the problems - most notably, lecture classes that didn''t meet and were treated as an independent study requiring a research paper or two - affected more than 3,100 students between 1993 and 2011.
Wainstein''s October report stated athletes made up roughly half the enrollments in problem courses typically featuring GPA-boosting grades, while also detailing how academic counselors enrolled athletes in those classes and how poor oversight throughout the university allowed the fraud to run unchecked for so long.
The NCAA didn''t charge UNC with academic fraud in its May 20 notice and limited its charge of improper benefits to between fall 2002 and summer 2011.
UNC must now file its response, which includes whether it agrees with the charge level and whether the facts are ''''substantially correct.'''' Athletic director Bubba Cunningham said Thursday that ''''some (allegations) I agreed with, some I did not'''' on his first read.
''''To do a thorough review, it does take time,'''' Cunningham said. ''''There''s a lot of data to review and the reviews go back quite some time. But I will also concur that it has been a difficult environment on the campus for us ... and I do think the length of time has impacted our ability to attract some of the students that would have committed to the institution in previous years.''''
Just don''t expect the process to move quickly. The school is allowed 90 days to respond, which is when it would self-impose penalties if it decided to do so.
Cunningham said UNC would likely take the full time allowed to respond.
The NCAA''s enforcement staff would then have 60 days to file its own response. That would ultimately lead to a hearing with the infractions committee, which typically issues a ruling and any sanctions within weeks to months.
This academic investigation grew out a 2010 investigation into the football program, with the committee issuing sanctions in March 2012 in that case roughly nine months after the notice of allegations arrived. A similar timeline would carry this case through at least February 2016 - approaching six years since the NCAA first arrived on campus.
UNC still faces questions from its accreditation agency - which is scheduled to decide next week on any potential sanctions - and several lawsuits from ex-UNC athletes.
Gene A. Marsh, who spent nine years on the NCAA''s infractions committee and a former chairman, said speculating on penalties facing UNC in the NCAA case is ''''just throwing darts.''''
''''I go back to the idea that people in athletics only find somebody to do this dance I''d call it ... if they find some partner on the other side - somebody to dance with,'''' said Marsh, a former faculty athletic representative at Alabama. ''''And that''s the academic side of the aisle.
''''So it is different and it''s broader in that it stretches over time and it affects a lot of different people, but it''s not the end of the Earth. Carolina will get past this and it''s a great academic institution. Everyone knows that. It doesn''t define the school.''''

PARIS (AP) -- Novak Djokovic has waited and waited to win his first French Open title and complete a career Grand Slam, worrying about when - or perhaps even whether - he would get another chance after coming close in recent years.
Now Djokovic must ponder all of that a little longer: His semifinal against Andy Murray was suspended in the fourth set Friday night, initially halted because of an impending storm and then put off altogether when the rain did arrive minutes later.
The No. 1-seeded Djokovic won the first two sets 6-3, 6-3 and appeared to be in control, before No. 3 Murray took the third 7-5. At 3-all in the fourth, with dark clouds moving in and light fading, they were ushered off the court. Djokovic and Murray will resume Saturday at 1 p.m. local time, a little more than 16 hours after they stopped.
The eventual winner will face a much-more-rested Stan Wawrinka of Switzerland in Sunday''s final.
The eighth-seeded Wawrinka, who eliminated Roger Federer in the quarterfinals, followed that up by defeating France''s Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-3, 6-7 (1), 7-6 (3), 6-4 in Friday''s opening semifinal. Wawrinka succeeded largely on the strength of one statistic: He saved 16 of 17 break points.
There were a few whistles and jeers directed at Wawrinka after he ended Tsonga''s bid to give France a men''s champion at its own tournament, something that last happened when Yannick Noah won in 1983.
''''Jo is always a tough player to play,'''' Wawrinka said, ''''especially when he''s playing at home.''''
The first chants of ''''Son-gah! Son-gah!'''' accompanied by rhythmic clapping arrived before the first point was played, and they returned over and over at key junctures, as did yells of ''''Allez, Jo!'''' and other support for Tsonga that prompted the chair umpire to ask for quiet.
The temperature topped 90 degrees (32 Celsius) at Court Philippe Chatrier, and the players wrapped towels filled with ice around their necks at changeovers to try to cool off.
''''Heat didn''t bother me,'''' Tsonga said. ''''My opponent made my life difficult.''''
A year ago, after winning the Australian Open championship, Wawrinka lost in the first round in Paris. Now he''s into his first French Open final and second at a major.
For Djokovic, so much is at stake this weekend.
Finish off Murray, and he would face Wawrinka with a chance to become only the eighth man in tennis history to own at least one trophy from each of the sport''s four most prestigious tournaments, adding to his five from the Australian Open, two from Wimbledon and one from the U.S. Open.
It would be Djokovic''s third appearance in the final in Paris.
He lost in 2012 and 2014 to Rafael Nadal, the nine-time champion whose 39-match Roland Garros winning streak was ended by Djokovic in this year''s quarterfinals.
Entering Friday, Djokovic was 40-2 this season, with 27 victories in a row.
He looked like that same, dominant player for the first two sets against Murray, a two-time major champion trying to become the first British man to reach the final in Paris since 1937.
But the Serb''s form began to dip in the third set, while Murray started to play better and better and tried to rile the crowd by motioning for more support. Murray broke Djokovic for the first time to go ahead 6-5 in the third, then served that set out at love - the first set Djokovic dropped over these two weeks.
After that, Djokovic went off the court to visit with a trainer, perhaps for treatment on the groin muscle problem he dealt with earlier in the tournament. Starting in the second set, and continuing into the third, Djokovic did deep knee bends and flexed his hips and upper legs.
The match was becoming more competitive, and the second game of the fourth set was tremendous. Djokovic held three break points, but failed to convert any. On one, a 34-stroke exchange that was the day''s longest, he put a forehand into the net. A too-long forehand ended a 28-stroke exchange on the game''s last point.
That was part of a run of nine consecutive points for Murray, who broke Djokovic at love to lead 2-1. But Djokovic is nothing if not a fighter, and when Murray dumped a forehand into the net, another break made it 2-all. Djokovic pumped his right fist and looked up at his guest box, where his wife stood, clapping and yelling.
They''ll all be back Saturday for more.

BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Making no apologies for how long it took to reach a decision, Boston Bruins rookie general manager Don Sweeney is confident that retaining coach Claude Julien for a ninth season is best for his team.
Sweeney made the announcement Friday, ending nearly two months of uncertainty over Julien''s future after the Bruins underwent a front-office shake up this spring.
''''I know there''s been speculation, and I wanted to make sure I put that to bed that I''m fully supporting this staff and looking forward to working with them,'''' Sweeney said. ''''Unequivocally, we''re moving forward with our group. I feel very good about that.''''
Though Julien and his entire staff are coming back for the start of next season, Sweeney declined to discuss their long-term job security after Boston missed the playoffs for the first time in eight years. The finish was disappointing for a high-priced team that won the Stanley Cup in 2011 and lost to Chicago in the final in 2013.
''''Well, it''s uncomfortable business,'''' Sweeney said. ''''I don''t think anybody accepts a job in this business without feeling ... uneasiness in terms of the result.''''
Sweeney spoke at a hotel in downtown Buffalo, where he and his staff are attending the NHL''s pre-draft scouting combine that concludes Saturday.
Hired two-and-a-half weeks ago after Peter Chiarelli was fired, Sweeney wanted to take his time and meet with Julien and his staff to ensure everyone was on the same page.
Sweeney, who previously worked as the Bruins assistant GM, based his decision on Julien''s past success, accountability and what he termed the ''''structure'''' of his coaching philosophy.
Julien has a 351-192-79 record with Boston, and has a 470-278-10-102 career record that includes his previous stints in Montreal and New Jersey.
He now has the longest active tenure with a single team among NHL coaches, after Mike Babcock left Detroit to coach the Toronto Maple Leafs last month.
The Bruins were eliminated on the final day of the regular season, and finished ninth in the Eastern Conference standings, one spot out of the playoffs.
The Bruins (41-27-14) were undone by a rash of injuries and an aging roster last season. The team also had difficulty making roster changes as a result of a payroll that nudged against the salary cap. Rather than adding talent, Boston was forced to free up space by trading key defenseman Johnny Boychuk to the New York Islanders before the start of the season.
Without going into detail, Sweeney noted that he has some decisions to make regarding the team''s roster before the NHL''s free agency period begins on July 1. And he added, Julien will have input on those decisions.
''''We do have to move a little bit in a different direction. And we''re at a bit of a crossroads in that regard,'''' Sweeney said.
Sweeney also challenged Julien and his staff to make some changes to their approach.
Believing the Bruins were too defensive-minded last season, he urged Julien to focus on developing more of an attacking style of system based on a faster transition.
Sweeney was running out of time and options if he intended to change coaches, with the NHL draft only three weeks away and the free-agency period opening on July 1.
Many of the top established candidates were taken off the market by teams filling their vacancies the past few weeks. Aside from Babcock, the Buffalo hired Dan Bylsma, Edmonton hired Todd McLellan and San Jose chose Peter DeBoer.

UNITED NATIONS U.N. agencies in Israel and the Palestinian territories reported an alarming number of child victims in last year''s war in the Gaza Strip but were split on whether Israel should be put on a list of violators of children''s rights, a U.N. document shows.
Their 22-page confidential country report, obtained by Reuters on Friday, was prepared by United Nations agencies on the ground for submission to the U.N. special envoy for children and armed conflict as she readied a draft of the annual list. 
The special envoy, Leila Zerrougui of Algeria, included Israel''s army and the Palestinian militant group Hamas in the draft she sent to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has final say on the list, U.N. sources have said.
More than 2,100 Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed in the conflict, while 67 Israeli soldiers and six civilians in Israel were killed. The country report said some 540 children were reportedly killed, 371 of them 12 years old or younger.  
The U.N. agencies'' country report, which was sent to Zerrougui to help her prepare her decision on whether to include Israel and Palestinian armed groups in her draft list to be passed on to Ban, has used strong language on alleged violations of children''s rights in the Gaza war.
It specified what it said were unlawful deaths and injuries of Palestinian children caused by Israeli forces, detention of Palestinian children and attacks on schools. It said more information was needed on the question of recruitment of children by Palestinian armed groups.
However, in a section that would appear to undermine the case for listing Israel, the country report said the heads of the U.N. agencies on the ground had failed to reach a consensus on whether to list Israel.
It said it was "not clear how the listing criteria should be applied and whether they had been satisfied."
Diplomats say the final version of the list, which names  grave violators of children''s rights in armed conflicts, could reach U.N. member states as early as the beginning of next week.
Whether to include the Jewish state is a politically charged issue for Israel and the United States. Some U.S. lawmakers have spoken out on the issue and Republican presidential hopeful Senator Ted Cruz wrote to Ban about it this week.
U.N. diplomatic sources told Reuters that Israel has lobbied hard against its inclusion and that Ban was leaning against  including Israel. Diplomats said U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power had urged Ban not to list Israel.
Ban has also received information from human rights groups, including New York-based Human Rights Watch, which issued a statement this week urging the U.N. not to give in pressure to keep Israel off the list.
Israel''s U.N. mission did not have an immediate response to the country report.
A U.N. inquiry published in April said Israeli soldiers had fired on seven U.N. schools during the Gaza war, killing 44 Palestinians who were sheltered at some of the sites, while Palestinian fighters hid weapons and launched attacks from several empty U.N. schools.
While Zerrougui''s report was being prepared, diplomatic sources told Reuters U.N. agency chiefs had felt pressured by Israel not to support including the Israeli army. Israel has said it should not be listed but denied pressuring anyone.

JIANLI, China The death toll from a Chinese cruise ship which capsized during a storm in the Yangtze River jumped to 331 on Saturday, leaving around 100 still missing, as the boat operator apologized and said it would cooperate with investigations.
Only 14 survivors, one of them the captain, have been found after the ship carrying 456 overturned in a freak tornado on Monday night.
Rescuers are searching the cabin of the ship, which was righted on Friday, looking for more bodies, the official People''s Daily, wrote on its microblog.
Jiang Zhao, general manager of the company which operated the Eastern Star, bowed in apology for the disaster during an interview with state media reported late on Friday, saying they would "fully" cooperate with the investigation.
Beijing has pledged there would be "no cover-up" in the  probe.
Police have detained the captain and chief engineer for questioning. An initial investigation found the ship was not overloaded and had enough life vests on board.
More than 1,000 family members have come to Jianli in the central province of Hubei, where the ship went down, with many expressing frustration at a lack of information from the government.
On Friday, an irate relative of two passengers missing aboard the ship burst into a just-concluded news conference with senior officials and publicly accused the government of treating its people like enemies.

 (181,'News','http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/ZOqo9GwvefM/story01.htm','Data hacked from U.S. government dates back to 1985: official

WASHINGTON Data stolen from U.S. government computers by suspected Chinese hackers included security clearance information and background checks dating back three decades, U.S. officials said on Friday, underlining the scope of one of the largest known cyber attacks on federal networks.
The breach of computer systems of the Office of Personnel Management was disclosed on Thursday by the Obama administration, which said records of up to 4 million current and former federal employees may have been compromised.
Accusations by U.S. government sources of a Chinese role in the cyber attack, including possible state sponsorship, could further strain ties between Washington and Beijing. Tensions are already heightened over Chinese assertiveness in pursuit of territorial claims in the South China Sea.
The hacking also raises questions about how the United States would respond if it confirmed that the Chinese government was behind it. 
Several U.S. officials, who requested anonymity, said the hackers were believed to have been based in China but that it was not yet known if the Chinese government or criminal elements were involved.
Another U.S. official said the breach was being investigated as a matter of national security, meaning it may have originated from a foreign government.
The cyber attack was among the most extensive thefts of information on the federal work force, and one U.S. defense official said it was clearly aimed at gaining valuable information for intelligence purposes.
"This is deep. The data goes back to 1985," a U.S. official said. "This means that they potentially have information about retirees, and they could know what they did after leaving government."
Access to data from OPM''s computers, such as birth dates, Social Security numbers and bank information, could help hackers test potential passwords to other sites, including those with information about weapons systems, the official said.
"That could give them a huge advantage," the official said.
According to a U.S. House of Representatives memo seen by Reuters, OPM knows what types of data were exposed to the hackers but not what data was taken. The memo was sent to House staff by Chief Administrative Officer Ed Cassidy, whose office provides support services to the House, including cyber security services.
In addition, the State Department said in a memo to its employees that most of them had not been exposed to the breach because their data was not housed on the hacked OPM systems. Only those who had previously been employed by another federal agency may have been exposed, it said.
Investigators have linked the OPM breach to earlier thefts of personal data from millions of records at Anthem Inc (ANTM.N), the second largest U.S. health insurer, and Premera Blue Cross, a healthcare services provider.
It was the second computer break-in in less than a year at OPM, the federal government''s personnel office, and the latest in a string of cyber attacks on U.S. agencies, some of which have been blamed on Chinese hackers.
A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said such accusations had been frequent of late and were irresponsible. Hacking attacks were often cross-border and hard to trace, he said.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said, "It''s not clear who the perpetrators are," but he noted that President Barack Obama and his aides regularly raise with their Chinese counterparts concerns about Chinese behavior in cyberspace.
Disclosure of the latest computer breach comes ahead of the annual U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue scheduled for  June 22-24 in Washington, D.C. Cyber security was already expected to be high on the agenda.
U.S. officials said the talks would proceed as scheduled, as would Obama''s plans to host Chinese President Xi Jinping on a state visit to Washington in the fall.

U.S. LIKELY TO MOVE CAUTIOUSLY
At Friday''s White House briefing, Earnest dodged the question of whether Washington might retaliate if it was determined that a state had been involved in the hacking.
In December, U.S. officials moved swiftly to accuse North Korea of being behind a high-profile attack on Sony (6758.T) over a movie depicting the assassination of North Korea''s leader, and Obama vowed that the United States would respond.
Some lawmakers and defense officials want a more aggressive U.S. stance against cyber breaches, including legislation to strengthen U.S. cyber defenses. But the administration is likely to move cautiously in response to any Chinese role, mindful of the potential harm from escalating cyber warfare between the world''s two biggest economies.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has launched a probe of the OPM attack, and vowed that it would bring to account those responsible for the hacking.
OPM detected new malicious activity affecting its information systems in April and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said it concluded early in May that OPM''s data had been compromised and about 4 million workers may have been affected.
Hackers hit OPM''s IT systems and its data stored at the Department of the Interior''s data center, a shared service center for federal agencies, a DHS official said on condition of anonymity.
Chinese hackers were also blamed for penetrating OPM''s computer networks last year, The New York Times reported last July, citing unnamed U.S. officials.
James Lewis, a cyber security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said the administration''s disclosure of the hacking could be a signal to China of Washington''s plan to push hard on cyber issues at this month''s talks.
“The Chinese have been saying privately, and somewhat in public, that we want the summit to go really well. ''Let’s not talk about espionage. Let’s talk about how we can work together''," said Lewis, a former State Department official. "This might be a U.S. response to that: ''No, we are going to talk about espionage.''"

UNITED NATIONS Western nations and Russia traded accusations at the United Nations on Friday over the recent upsurge in violence in eastern Ukraine, while a senior member of an international monitoring team blamed both sides in the conflict for breaking a ceasefire.
The diplomatic clash between European, U.S. and Russian envoys came a day after Ukraine warned of a possible "full-scale invasion" by Russia, following the worst fighting with Russian-backed separatists in months.
The deputy head of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe''s (OSCE) monitoring mission, Alexander Hug, was more balanced in his remarks to the Security Council. He said both sides of the conflict were putting civilians at risk as the security situation deteriorates.
"Civilians continue to bear an unacceptable price in this conflict," Hug told an emergency meeting of the 15-nation council. "They are killed and wounded, as both sides continue to place military positions in and around civilian infrastructure. Their property and livelihoods have been destroyed."
Britain placed the blame for the new violence squarely on Moscow.
"This was a separatist assault on Ukrainian military units," said British Ambassador Matthew Rycroft, adding that it was "clearly premeditated."
"The separatist forces are Russia''s creation, they are Russia''s tool," he said. "Russia has the capacity and the influence to control the separatist forces. It must exercise that influence to ensure compliance with the Minsk agreements."
He was referring to a ceasefire agreement clinched in February in the Belarusian capital.
Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin presented the opposite view. He blamed the latest fighting on Kiev, saying it was violating the Minsk agreement and putting civilians at risk.
"If we allow Kiev to continue... the situation could fall out of control," he said.
U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power cited Twitter announcements by separatist fighters boasting of a successful attack on Marinka, Ukraine. She said Russia continues to deny the "open secret" that it arms the rebels and sends Russian soldiers to die anonymously in neighboring Ukraine.
French Ambassador Francois Delattre echoed Power''s remarks: "Everyone knows the role that they''ve (Russia) been playing in this crisis since the start."
The ambassadors of Lithuania and Ukraine said Kiev had a right to defend itself against the Russian-backed rebels.
Kiev and its NATO allies accuse Russia of sending weapons and troops to fight on behalf of separatists who control part of two provinces in its east. Moscow, which seized and annexed Ukraine''s Crimea peninsula last year, denies its troops are participating.

UNITED NATIONS U.N. agencies in Israel and the Palestinian territories reported an alarming number of child victims in last year''s war in the Gaza Strip but were split on whether Israel should be put on a list of violators of children''s rights, a U.N. document said.
The 22-page confidential country report, obtained by Reuters on Friday, was prepared by United Nations agencies on the ground for submission to the U.N. special envoy for children and armed conflict as she readied a draft of the annual list. 
The special envoy, Leila Zerrougui of Algeria, included Israel''s army and the Palestinian militant group Hamas in the draft she sent to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has final say on the list, U.N. sources have said.
Diplomats say the final version of the list, which names  grave violators of children''s rights in armed conflicts, could reach U.N. member states as early as the beginning of next week.
More than 2,100 Palestinians, mostly civilians, were killed in the conflict, while 67 Israeli soldiers and six civilians in Israel were killed. The country report said some 540 children were reportedly killed, 371 of them 12 years old or younger.
Whether to include the Jewish state is a politically charged issue for Israel and the United States. Some U.S. lawmakers have spoken out on the issue and Republican presidential hopeful Senator Ted Cruz wrote to Ban about it this week.
U.N. diplomatic sources told Reuters that Israel has lobbied hard against its inclusion and that Ban was leaning against  including Israel. Diplomats said U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha Power had urged Ban not to list Israel.
The draft report has strong language on alleged violations of children''s rights in the Gaza war.
It specified what it said were unlawful deaths and injuries of Palestinian children caused by Israeli forces, detention of Palestinian children and attacks on schools. It said more information was needed on the question of recruitment of children by Palestinian armed groups.

UNITED NATIONS The United Nations Security Council on Friday condemned continued indiscriminate attacks on civilians in Syria, including aerial bombardment and barrel bombings that Western powers say only the government is capable of carrying out.
Last week the U.N. humanitarian chief painted a harrowing portrait of savagery in Syria''s civil war, now in its fifth year, and urged the Security Council to take collective action to put an end to the carnage.
The war has killed more than 220,000 people. Of the country''s roughly 23 million people, some 12.2 million are in need of humanitarian aid, including 5 million children.
"The members of the Security Council expressed their deep concern at the continued high level of violence in Syria and condemned all violence directed against civilians and civilian infrastructure, including medical facilities," the council said in a statement.
"They expressed outrage at all attacks against civilians, as well as indiscriminate attacks, including those involving shelling and aerial bombardment, such as the use of barrel bombs, which have reportedly been extensively used in recent days in Aleppo," it said.
Western officials blame aerial and barrel bomb attacks on the government.
Several Western council members noted that the unanimously adopted statement had the backing of Russia, which has strongly supported the government of President Bashar al-Assad.
Russia, backed by China, has vetoed four Security Council resolutions on Syria, three of them threatening the government with sanctions and another calling for referring the war to the International Criminal Court in The Hague for possible war crimes indictments.  
The United States wants the council to approve a U.N. investigation to determine who is to blame for chemicals weapons attacks in Syria. Success of this initiative will ultimately depend on Russia, which blames rebels for chemical attacks. Rebels and Western powers blame Assad''s forces.
The council also "condemned increased terrorist attacks resulting in numerous casualties and destruction carried out by ISIL (Islamic State), al Nusra Front and other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with al Qaeda."
The Security Council also voiced support for U.N. Syria peace mediator Staffan de Mistura, who has started a new attempt to broker negotiations between rebel groups and the government. Western and Arab officials say they have little hope that a breakthrough is imminent.
Last month, Syria''s main political opposition group complained about de Mistura''s decision to include Iran, which, like Russia, has been a strong supporter of Assad.

BOSTON Two college friends of the Boston Marathon bomber were sentenced to prison on Friday for removing a backpack containing empty fireworks shells from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev''s dorm room amid a massive manhunt three days after the deadly 2013 attack.
Kazakh exchange student Azamat Tazhayakov was sentenced to 3-1/2 years for obstructing justice by taking, with his roommate, Tsarnaev''s pack and dropping it in a dumpster by the off-campus apartment they shared.
Robel Phillipos, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, was sentenced to three years in prison for lying to investigators about the incident, which occurred in the hours after the FBI released images of Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, identifying them as suspects.
A third friend, Dias Kadyrbayev, also of Kazakhstan, was sentenced on Tuesday to six years after pleading guilty to obstructing the investigation into the attack that killed three people and injured 264.
The United States never claimed that the three men had any advanced knowledge of the bombing plan, one of the highest-profile attacks on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001..
Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev made statements of apology to the court for their crimes. Phillipos opted not to speak, citing a planned appeal of his conviction.
"It just makes me sick what Dzhokhar did," Tazhayakov told the court, holding back tears. "I didn''t go there to the dorm room because I made connection that Dzhokhar was some jihadist. I never thought about it. At that moment I saw that one of my friends was alleged bomber and I didn''t know if it was true."
Prosecutors had sought a four-year sentence for Tazhayakov, which they said reflected his willingness to testify against Tsarnaev. They were seeking a five-year, three-month sentence for Phillipos.
Phillipos'' mother, Genet Bekele, suggested in a written statement to reporters that her son was a victim of overzealous prosecution.
"We are very disappointed with the judge''s decision," Bekele said. "My son was caught in a political storm in a situation that was incredibly hard to deal with." 
All three men, along with Tsarnaev, were 19-year-old students at the University of Massachusetts at the time of the bombing.
Tsarnaev was sentenced to death last month by the same jury that found him guilty of the April 15, 2013, attack.
During their trials last year, lawyers for Tazhayakov and Phillipos painted their clients as naive, marijuana-smoking teenagers who did not understand the consequences of removing the backpack from Tsarnaev''s dorm room.
Kadyrbayev later threw the backpack into a dumpster by the apartment he shared with Tazhayakov. FBI investigators recovered it from a landfill several days later.
Empty fireworks shells found by the backpack were shown as evidence at Tsarnaev''s trial.
U.S. District Judge Douglas Woodlock told Phillipos he thought little of his defense strategy, that he had been too high on marijuana at the time of the dorm visit to remember his actions and thus unable to lie about the.
Noting that the United States is in the midst of a debate over whether to decriminalize or legalize the drug, he said Phillipos'' case illustrated some limits.
"What''s being and has been presented and rejected by the jury is the idea that marijuana use is a defense," Woodlock said. "It seems to that has to be addressed head on by saying, if we give the right to legal use of marijuana, we''re not giving a defense in a criminal case."
Unlike Tazhayakov and Kadyrbayev, who have been in federal custody for more than two years, Phillipos has been on house arrest since he was first charged. He was ordered to surrender to the U.S. Marshals Service on July 24.

WASHINGTON U.S. job growth accelerated sharply in May and wages picked up, signs of strong momentum in the economy that bolster prospects for a Federal Reserve interest rate hike in September.
Nonfarm payrolls increased 280,000 last month, the largest gain since December, the Labor Department said on Friday.
While the unemployment rate rose to 5.5 percent from a near seven-year low of 5.4 percent in April, that was because more people, including new college graduates, entered the labor force, indicating confidence in the jobs market.
"Today''s strong jobs report shows that the underlying trend in the economy is continuing to improve. This leaves the Fed on course to start hiking rates in September," said Michelle Meyer, senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York.
The report joined May automobile sales and manufacturing data in suggesting economic activity was gaining traction after a slow start in the second quarter.
Doubts had sprung up in financial markets over whether the Fed would be able to raise rates this year after a first-quarter contraction in GDP and a string of weak data in April, including soft figures on consumer spending and industrial production. 
The jobs data helped dispel those doubts. The dollar raced to a 13-year peak versus the yen and surged against the euro. Prices for U.S. government debt fell sharply, with the yield on the two-year note rising to a more than four-year high. 
Stocks on Wall Street ended mostly lower.
Average hourly earnings, which had long been the missing piece in the jobs recovery and one closely watched by Fed policymakers, rose eights cents. In addition, payrolls for March and April were revised to show 32,000 more jobs created than previously reported, giving the report a healthy glow.
Traders in futures markets brought up their expectations for a rate hike to October from December. Fed officials, who have kept overnight borrowing costs near zero since December 2008, meet on June 16-17 to plot their course.

GAINING MOMENTUM
"First-quarter GDP is looking even more anomalous, and some of the recent growth concerns should be mollified by the latest job growth figures," said Michael Feroli, an economist JPMorgan in New York. 
Economists had forecast payrolls rising 225,000 last month, with the unemployment rate steady. May''s payroll gains lifted job growth above last year''s average of 260,000 jobs per month. 
Despite May''s rise in the jobless rate, it remains not too far from the 5.0-5.2 percent range that most Fed officials consider consistent with full employment.
Policymakers will also be encouraged by the return of some discouraged job seekers to the labor market.
The labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, increased 0.1 percentage point to 62.9 percent, a four-month high. The number of discouraged workers in May was the lowest since October 2008, and the percentage of the working-age population employed hit its highest level since June 2009.
"These formerly frustrated workers are returning to the labor force as a pick-up in hiring activity and record-high job openings have been increasing their chances of finding a job," said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York.
In May, 28.6 percent of the unemployed had been out of work for 27 weeks or more, the lowest rate in six years. A broad measure of joblessness that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment was unchanged at 10.8 percent. 
Last month''s increase in average hourly earnings took the year-on-year gain to 2.3 percent, the largest rise since August 2013. The mix of jobs gains and higher wages lifted the aggregate weekly payrolls index, a proxy for take-home wages, 0.5 percent in May and 4.9 percent over the year.  
Further gains are expected given firming demand for entry-level workers and a better composition of jobs that are being created. In addition, many states have raised the minimum wage and some corporations are increasing pay for workers.
Walmart (WMT.N), the largest private employer in the United States, this week announced it would raise minimum wages for more than 100,000 U.S. workers, its second wage hike this year. 
Payroll gains last month were broad-based, though the mining sector purged jobs again as it continued to work through the thousands of cuts announced by oil-field companies. The 18,000 mining jobs lost in May marked a fifth straight monthly decline. 
Among sector heavyweights, Schlumberger (SLB.N) has announced about 20,000 layoffs this year, while Baker Hughes (BHI.N) and Halliburton (HAL.N) are also cutting thousands of jobs.
Manufacturing employment increased 7,000, while construction employment payrolls rose by 17,000.

DIYARBAKIR, Turkey Two blasts ripped through a Kurdish rally in Turkey on Friday, killing two people and injuring more than 100 in what President Tayyip Erdogan described as a "provocation" designed to undermine peace before Sunday''s parliamentary election.
The explosions occurred as tens of thousands of people gathered for the pro-Kurdish Peoples'' Democratic Party (HDP) election rally in Diyarbakir, the largest city in mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey.
Initial reports said there had been one explosion but a senior security source told Reuters there were two blasts.   Officials initially blamed a faulty power transformer at the rally site but later ruled that possibility out. 
Eyewitness Guy Martin, a British photographer, told Reuters the blasts occurred some five minutes apart - the first in a rubbish bin which was ripped apart and the second in front a power generator. In the aftermath he saw one person who had lost a leg and others with shrapnel wounds.
"It was a heart-shaking, ribcage-shaking noise, he said of one of the blasts. "The most terrifying thing is that crush of people. It was chaos, I couldn’t move, people were panicking."
"The police started firing teargas at people who were helping the injured or fleeing the scene this enflamed the situation," he added. "The mood is angry. People want revenge."
The explosions killed two people and injured more than 100, Erdogan said in an interview with broadcaster ATV, having earlier expressed condolences for the victims.
"It is very important that all our citizens are careful in the face of provocations like this aimed at undermining our democracy, the atmosphere of peace and brotherhood in our country," he said in a statement.
Tensions have run high as the HDP campaigns to become the first party with Kurdish origins to win seats in parliament in Sunday''s election. Previously, Kurdish MPs have joined the legislature as independents.
The HDP needs to overcome a 10 percent vote threshold, and some opinion polls show it could seize enough seats to deprive the long-ruling AK Party of the majority it has enjoyed since sweeping to power in 2002.

POLICE FIRE WATER CANNON
HDP Chairman Selahattin Demirtas called on his supporters to remain calm.
"We don''t know the cause of the blast," he told CNN Turk. "It is thought-provoking that this occurred so close to the election," he added.
Television footage showed people carrying the injured on stretchers as organizers of the rally for the pro-Kurdish HDP announced on loudspeakers that the explosion had been caused by a fault in a power generator and urged people to stay calm. 
The explosion rocked the parade ground just before Demirtas was to address the crowd. Police fired water cannon to disperse protesters who remained at the parade ground. The rally was subsequently canceled.
Security has been tight at HDP political rallies. On Thursday, nationalists clashed with HDP supporters at a Demirtas rally in the northern town of Erzurum.
Demirtas has said his party has been the target of more than 70 violent attacks during the campaign.
Erdogan, who used to head the AK Party, has accused the HDP of being a front for the Kurdistan Workers'' Party (PKK), which took up arms in 1984 in an insurgency that killed 40,000 people. 
Jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan and Ankara launched peace talks more than two years ago.

BUENOS AIRES Pro-business Buenos Aires Mayor Mauricio Macri has ruled out forming an alliance with fellow opposition candidate Sergio Massa ahead of Argentina''s October presidential election, Macri''s campaign team said on Friday.
Speculation has swirled of a deal between the two to defeat the ruling Front for Victory party candidate, Daniel Scioli.
Scioli holds a wafer-thin lead over Macri in polls, as the clock ticks toward a June 10 deadline for parties to declare alliances.
Massa, a former cabinet chief to President Cristina Fernandez, left the leftist ruling coalition in 2013. His popularity has faded this year, and a tie-up with center-right Macri could strengthen the opposition.
A Massa spokesman said all options remained on the table. Macri''s camp dismissed talk of a deal.
"They have already given all they have to give. We''re betting on individuals who have no connection with the running of the country in recent years to lead Argentina with fresh ideas," Macri''s campaign office said in an emailed comment.
Massa pitches himself as a centrist within the broad Peronist movement that has ruled Argentina for all but eight years since the return of democracy in 1983. But his campaign is faltering. 
Massa has burned bridges with Fernandez loyalists, while many opposition and swing voters still associate the lawmaker with Fernandez''s turbulent years in power. Some senior officials in Massa''s Front for Renewal have defected back to the ruling coalition.
An opinion poll by Management & Fit in late May showed Scioli and Macri running neck and neck, almost 20 points ahead of Massa, who had 13.8 percent of voter support. In December, Management & Fit had Massa within 7.5 percent of Scioli. Other pollsters had him leading.
Both Scioli and Macri paint the presidential contest as a two horse race, although Scioli faces a test in his own party primary in August. [ID:nL6N0WW4R2]
Rumors of an accord gained momentum on Thursday after Fernandez''s cabinet chief, Anibal Fernandez, speculated Massa would run for governor of the powerful Buenos Aires province in an alliance with Macri.
"Nothing can be ruled out," a Massa spokesman said.
While a deal with Massa would raise Macri''s profile in regions where he has little backing, it would weaken his claim to be the candidate of wholesale change. Many Massa voters could switch their support to Scioli rather than back a non-Peronist.
Macri "wants to run as a pure opposition candidate and represent a ''new political'' movement," said Daniel Kerner of Eurasia Group.

JIANLI, China An irate relative of two passengers missing aboard a Chinese cruise ship which capsized on the Yangtze River publicly accused the government of treating its people like enemies, as officials struggled to contain public anger over the disaster.
Only 14 survivors, one of them the captain, have been found after the ship carrying 456 overturned in a freak tornado on Monday night. A total of 103 bodies have been found.
Frustration over the lack of information has grown among families of the missing. Seventy-year-old Xia Yunchen burst into a just finished news briefing with senior officials on Friday, screaming and demanding answers.
"Is it necessary to treat the common people, one by one, as if you are facing some kind of formidable foe?" said Xia, whose sister and brother-in-law were aboard the Eastern Star.
Xia, from the eastern city of Qingdao, told reporters she had wanted to get into the news conference to hear for herself what the government was saying, and that she wanted an honest investigation because family members doubted the weather was the real cause of the disaster.
"You view the common people as if we are all your enemy. We are tax payers. We support the government. You had better change your notion of this relationship. You are here to serve us. You need to be humane," Xia said, before being escorted out.
Police then kept reporters back behind a closed gate while they moved away relatives and passersby on the street outside.
About 1,200 relatives have converged on Jianli county in Hubei province where the disaster happened.
"My most important hope in coming here is still the same - to lay eyes on my mother," said Zhang Junmin.
Another relative, who asked not to be identified, sent a Reuters reporter a picture from their hotel room showing three police cars parked outside, by way of explaining why they were too nervous to meet.
Aware of the sensitivity of the disaster, the ruling Communist Party''s Politburo Standing Committee, China''s apex of power, called on local authorities to take measures to help grieving families and to "earnestly safeguard social stability".

"NO COVER-UP"
Rescuers, many from the military, worked through the night to right the four-deck ship. Pictures on state television showed the ship, which had capsized completely, sitting upright in the water. Large dents and gashes scarred its blue roof.
Rescuers will continue searching for the victims as they bail out water from the ship for the next five to six hours, said Xu Chengguang, a spokesman for the transport ministry, at a news conference.
Dozens of relatives gathered in front of the crematorium, demanding to be allowed inside. Many carried bouquets of flowers.
The crematorium gates were manned by uniformed police, who initially refused to let them inside. They were later allowed in after foreign reporters arrived on a government-organized bus tour.
Relatives have asked the government to release the names of survivors and the confirmed deaths, and questioned why most of those rescued were crew members. 
Some have demanded to know why the boat did not dock in the storm, and how the rescued captain and crew members had time to put on life vests but did not sound any alarm. 
Beijing has pledged there would be "no cover-up" in the  investigation.
Police have detained the captain and chief engineer for questioning, though authorities have given no details. An initial investigation found the ship was not overloaded and had enough life vests on board.
On Thursday, more than 200 divers had groped through murky water after cutting through the hull, searching every cabin on board, but found no more survivors.

WASHINGTON The United States has quietly started delivering promised arms for Iraqi soldiers from a $1.6 billion fund approved by Congress last year, officials said, following mounting Iraqi frustration over the pace of coalition assistance.
The Pentagon said long-awaited equipment from the Iraq Train and Equip Fund (ITEF) started being fielded about two weeks ago and was moving as fast as possible. Officials noted extensive, previous arms transfers under different U.S. authorities.
Iraq''s Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi laid bare his frustrations at a gathering in Paris this week, saying Baghdad had received "almost none" of the promised international assistance.
"They''re complaining the program is too slow. But the fact is it''s a slow system," said Douglas Ollivant, a former Iraq adviser in the Obama and Bush administrations. 
By contrast, he added, "they tell the Russians they want fighter planes and they show up in a month."
The first U.S. material provided to Iraqi forces under ITEF outfitted an Iraqi army brigade with rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers, mortars, protective masks and other gear. 
And more arms were on the way, Pentagon spokeswoman Commander Elissa Smith said. 
"This is the first of several planned unit equipment issues
for the coming weeks, which will include Peshmerga units," said
Smith, referring to Kurdish forces. 
She said the first issue of equipment from the fund to Iraq''s army occurred the week of May 18th, the same week that Ramadi fell to Islamic State, handing the Iraqi military its biggest defeat in nearly a year. A delivery of AT-4 anti-tank weapons last weekend also came from the fund, she said.
"We are, in terms of ITEF, still close to its starting point," a U.S. government official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.

DELIVERIES SEEN AS TOO SLOW 
A Pentagon document completed last year detailed plans for
ITEF to provide a host of U.S. equipment, ranging from 45,000 pieces of body armor for Iraqi forces to 14,400 M4 rifles for Kurdish forces. Sunni fighters would get 5,000 AK-47 assault rifles. (Click 1.usa.gov/11nsTuN to read the document.)
U.S. officials acknowledge that a big test of the program will be getting the Shi''ite-led government in Baghdad to arm Sunni tribes, a crucial step, they say, toward reconciliation.
While arms are just part of a broader U.S. effort that includes air strikes, training and surveillance, the Iraqis see the pace of the weapons flow from Washington as one of the few measurable gauges of President Barack Obama''s commitment to the fight - and they say the deliveries are too slow. Obama has already ruled out any major deployment of "boots on the ground." 
    Still, some U.S. officials feel that Abadi''s complaints about weapons and other assistance broadly reflect domestic pressure, particularly after the fall of Ramadi last month. 
"He''s feeling pressure from all sides," one official said.
The Pentagon has cited coalition deliveries of tens of millions of rounds of ammunition and hundreds of vehicles to Iraq since last summer. The bulk of these were provided through different authorities than ITEF, such as coalition donations and traditional foreign military sales.
"A lack of weapons and ammunition is not the central problem," said a U.S. military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, citing instead "vulnerabilities in organization and leadership" of Iraq''s security forces. 
U.S. officials appeared to play down concerns about whether Iraq would be able to secure newly-provided weapons, after abandoned U.S.-provided arms and vehicles repeatedly ended up in Islamic State hands over the past year.
"Loss of weapons is an inherent risk when arming an allied military during active conflict," the military official said.

PESHAWAR, Pakistan A Pakistani court has freed eight out of 10 men charged with organizing the shooting of schoolgirl activist Malala Yousafzai, police said on Friday, a move that will raise further questions about the nation''s heavily criticized justice system.
Pakistani Taliban militants claimed responsibility for attacking Malala in 2012 as she traveled home from school in Swat, northwest of the capital Islamabad. She was shot in the head and airlifted to Britain for treatment, where she now lives. Two other schoolgirls were also wounded.
Malala became a global symbol of defiance after she campaigned for girls'' education despite Taliban repression and she won the 2014 Nobel Peace prize. 
Senior police official Salim Khan said the eight men were freed because there was not enough evidence to connect them to the 2012 attack. 
Police had said in April that all 10 had been convicted and jailed for 25 years each in a trial held behind closed doors. It was not clear why officials had given incorrect information. 
"The only reason for their release was lack of proof against them," Khan said. 
Prosecutor Naeem Khan said the men had confessed to the court that they had helped plan the attack. 
None of the accused were suspected of being the gunmen, who security officials believe fled to Afghanistan. 
"During the trial, all the 10 persons had admitted and confessed their role in Malala''s attack before the judge of the anti-terrorism court. But only two of them, Izhar Khan and Israrullah Khan, were convicted while the remaining eight were freed," Khan said.
He said the trial had been conducted inside the main prison in Swat Jail after militant threats. 
Khan said he filed an appeal against the acquittal on May 18 but the men had already been freed on April 30.
The case will raise further questions over police competence, accountability and secret trials in Pakistan.
Police are poorly trained and equipped. Most officers have never been trained in how to gather evidence and rarely follow basic procedures such as securing crime scenes. Cases mostly hinge on highly unreliable oral testimony, leading judges to frequently dismiss charges involving major militant attacks. 
Trials are often held behind closed doors because judges, lawyers and witnesses fear retribution from militants.

LONDON Greece cannot accept the latest proposals for a cash-for-reforms deal put on the table by its international lenders but was prepared to negotiate a compromise, Greek Economy Minister George Stathakis said on Friday.
Greece delayed a key debt payment to the International Monetary Fund due on Friday as Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras demanded changes to tough terms from international creditors for aid to stave off default.
Stathakis said Greece had the money to pay, but had accepted an offer from the IMF to bundle four payments due in June into a single 1.6 billion euro lump sum due at the end of the month.
"We are looking forward to getting a deal as soon as possible," he told BBC Radio, but said that while Greece was ready to discuss compromises, it would not accept proposed fiscal adjustments for 2015 and 2016.
"It was actually included in their proposal without being on the negotiation table during the last month ... the Greek government cannot accept these new proposals," he said.
Asked if Greece was prepared to leave the euro zone, Stathakis said his Syriza party, elected in January on a promise to end austerity, had not been given a mandate to do that by the Greek people.
"Our government has a mandate to remain in the euro and get a better deal to ... try to change the terms of the agreement that we have with European partners," he said. "Greece has to remain within the euro."
