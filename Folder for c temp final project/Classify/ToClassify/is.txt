On Thursday from 6 to 8 p.m., Viktor & Rolf will celebrate the first birthday of its haute confectionary scent, Bonbon, at Saks Fifth Avenue. With any two-piece purchase from the fragrance collection, including the new satin body powder ($80) and limited-edition eau de parfum shimmer bottle ($120), customers will receive a free sketch from the illustrator Brooke Hagel, inspired by runway looks from the fashion house.
