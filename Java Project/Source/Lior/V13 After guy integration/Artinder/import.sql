And when it does, unless youre like Hallie from The Parent Trap who grew up around vintages and varietals, youre left kind of fumbling around, swirling whatever you ordered at the restaurant in the glass and smelling it in an attempt to seem like you know what the hell youre doing. Even worse? The wine store, where all wino knowledge goes out the window in favor of a bright bottle with some cool calligraphy on its label. (That means its fancy, right?)\r\n\r\nBUT NO MORE. You are an adult, goddammit, and you should A) at least have a working knowledge of varietals, AKA the type of grape used for the wine, lest you become one of those poor fools who, thanks to Waka Flocka Flame, goes into a bar to order Moscato only to realize its a sweet wine, and B) talk about something you imbibe on the regular with some kind of authority.\r\n\r\nWe caught up with Michael Turley, manager and wine director of NYCs Irvington restaurant, for the easiest-to-remember tips on choosing a great wine. (Cause we know youre not going to write this down.)\r\n\r\n\r\nWE RECOMMEND\r\nWhy Prunes Gabrielle Hamilton Makes It a Point to Hire Women\r\n*READ* THE LABEL\r\nI know, I know. We just said were not going to look at the label, but were not talking about looking for a cute font. Read, young grasshopper. While wines that say "table wine" or "California wine" might be perfectly delicious, they also raise red flags. "These wines are composed of grapes from a very large region (a state or even an entire country) and, although sometimes just fine in quality, tend to be noticeably bland or unbalanced," says Turley.\r\n\r\nRECOGNIZE WHY SOMETHINGS ON SALE\r\nWhile your local wine store might just have crazy deals all the time, most stores put wine on sale for two reasons, according to Turley. 1) The ideal consumption window for the vintage has come and gone, or 2) the wine just isnt selling and the store wants to clear out inventory. Neither of these things necessarily equal a bad wine, but its something to look out for before stocking up on that Pinot Noir just because its marked down 10 bucks.\r\n\r\nKNOW YOUR ADJECTIVES\r\nThis is a big distinction—especially for those who say they hate "sweet wines." "There is a difference between a sweet wine and one that is fruit-forward," notes Turley. "Sweet wines, like a port or some Rieslings, tend to be more syrupy, which is wines way of exhibiting sweetness. But a wine may have a nose of tropical fruit and honeysuckle but, upon tasting, are crisp, clean and wash out the mouth in a quick flush." So stop with the vague terms, friends. (And know which one to ask for.)\r\n\r\nCHOOSE EASY PAIRINGS\r\nPairings—this is when things get interesting. As Turley notes, there are two schools of thoughts when it comes to wine and food pairings: complementary and contrasting. Neither is wrong. (So if someone tries to argue with your Twinkies and Gewürztraminer, remind them that it they are both sweet and pull a Jan from Grease: "It says right here, it is a dessert wine.") If going the complementary route, just remember light with light and rich with rich. Meaning seafoods and chicken pair amazingly with crisp white wines and red meats and cheeses pair well with full-bodied reds. As for a great contrasting pairing? "Classic oysters with a New World Sauvignon Blanc, such as a great option from New Zealand," says Turley. "The salty brine of the oysters is balanced by the fruit-forward expression of this grape. Think of it like peanut butter and jelly."\r\n\r\nWHEN IN DOUBT? GO FOR A ROSÉ\r\nI know youre probably saying "whaaaaat?" but its true. "A crisp, dry rosé will have refreshing acidity and lively effervescence to help accent most dishes," says Turley. "Rosés also work especially well with cheese plates." Turley recommends a *sparkling* rosé. (Ooh la la.)\r\n\r\nIF ALL ELSE FAILS, DOWNLOAD AN APP\r\n"I am a committed fan of the Wine Spectator app, which has a comprehensive database of wine ratings organized by price points and varietals," says Turley. "Comparing ratings with prices can help make the decision a no-brainer."\r\n\r\nSTILL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOURE DOING? HERE ARE TURLEYS TOP 5 PICKS (YOURE WELCOME)\r\n\r\n1) Indabas 2014 Western Cape Chenin Blanc; $7 "Round and lush, with a great, long finish."\r\n\r\n2) Layer Cakes 2013 Central Coast Chardonnay; $16 "Classic varietal expression with ripe apple and honeydew melon flavors."\r\n\r\n3) Bodegas Ramón Bilbaos 2011 Garnacha Rioja; $20 "Rich berries, chocolate, and spices PLUS great structure and style?

(3, 'Fashion', 'WWW.ELLE.COM', 'BRUCE JENNERS TRANSITION STORY MAKES "KEEPING UP WITH THE KARDASHIANS" WORTH IT\r\n\n\n  Last night, in a moving (and path-paving) interview with 20/20s Diane Sawyer, Bruce Jenner, the Kardashian clans patriarch, revealed what several media outlets have been speculating since early last year: Hes transitioning and will soon be living exclusively as the female hes known he was since age eight. "For all intents and purposes," he told Sawyer, "I am a woman."\r\n\r\n"My whole life," he said, "has been preparing for this moment."\r\n\r\nThe 1976 decathlon gold medalist who forged a lucrative career as a motivational speaker in the 80s before becoming the muted father figure on E!s hit reality series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, confessed to sneaking into his sisters closet to try on one of her dresses as a kid. "I put a scarf over my short hair" he recalled, and walked around outside. "I didnt know why I was doing it," he said, noting that there were no trans cultural guideposts at the time to help him understand the discontinuity he felt between his body and gender, "It just made me feel good."\r\n\r\n\r\nWE RECOMMEND\r\nYou Can Now Legally Serve Divorce Papers Over Facebook\r\nWhile he was able to channel his inner turmoil and self-discomfort into a spectacular athletic career—and distract himself with three marriages and ten children over the years—his gender demanded self expression, even if only in the privacy of his own home, but with a family as big as his, the house was rarely entirely empty. He told Sawyer about two incidents during which Kim Kardashian, his stepdaughter, and Kendall, his daughter with ex-wife, Kris, caught him in womens clothes.\r\n\r\n"Kim walked out, jumped in the car went for a drive," and didnt bring it up again until reports of his transition hit the presses years later. Kendall discovered his secret via digital footage: She thought her younger sister Kylie was stealing her clothes so she put her computer on security mode and it captured her dads every move as soon as he walked in to check out his outfit in their full-length mirror.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the interview, there was a sweet exchange between Jenner and Sawyer. He invited her into his closet to show her the elegantly sexy black dress hed later wear at their off-camera one-on-one dinner together. His eyes sparkled as he shared it with her.\r\n\r\nThese sartorial moments and memories, along with a few other things, struck me when watching the special. First, I should say that I think its invaluably important that Jenner brought his story to the national stage—his sacrifice for the greater good of the trans community cannot be underestimated. But since it wasnt addressed in ABCs two hour program, I think its worth remembering that there is not only one way to be trans. There are several degrees and varying formulations of tranness, some of which dont call for sex confirmation surgery or even hormone therapy. Some like to stay in an ambiguous limbo between sexes.\r\n\r\nThis point, which is relevant as a reminder that there isnt one blueprint for trans actualization, leads me to an odd self-discovery recently. While Ive always identified as lesbian, Ive had the recent realization that my gender doesnt sync up with my body as squarely as Ive tried to think. As someone who regularly watches Female to Male video diaries to marvel at the muscle-building power of testosterone shots with the unfulfilled hope of gaining as much mass sans shots, and as someone who has never looked at a female body for workout inspiration but rather pulls up Brad Pitt or a young Marlon Brando in a Google image search for motivation, Im not entirely sure that I dont straddle some unmarked line between standard fair dyke and quasi transman. There is so much overlap, which is why I felt so acutely Jenners painful, awkward, and exhilarating memories of secretly trying on womens garb.\r\n\r\nHis anecdotes remind me how vital clothing is to self-understanding and expression. What to wear is not a trivial or small decision—every day its an active creative form of self assertion. I think its a significant part of gender presentation that bears contemplation and elaboration. As a fledgling dyke growing up in the 80s, my gender didnt at all align with my mothers feminine preferences for my wardrobe. Shed often confine me to dresses, which was so out of whack with my self conception, Id weep in protest, while coveting (and sometimes stealing) my brothers clothes. It was agonizing. It was cruel. She didnt know any better, and perhaps now she will.\r\n\r\nWhether or not you consider the Kardashian tribe to be vapid, perhaps symptomatic of cultural decline as some highbrows contend, their entire (superficial) enterprise may have been worth it for what Jenner called this "one real, true story."\r\n\r\n"Jenners transition as such a public icon is a cultural milestone," transman Shannon Minter, who heads the legal division of the National Center for Lesbian Rights in San Francisco, CA, tells ELLE.com. "Jenners story has the potential to greatly increase public understanding and support."\r\n\r\nTrans rights activist and director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, Mara Keisling agreed: "Stories like Jenners help change the narrative about who transgender people are. Millions of Americans now have a bridge to understanding the truth behind the struggles of being transgender in 2015 America."\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most eloquent words and sentiments came from multi-hypenate "genius" Kanye West when he explained why his wife Kim must offer Jenner her full support and love. According to Jenner, Kanye told Kim: "Look, I can be married to the most beautiful woman in the world, and I am. I can have the most beautiful little daughter in the world, and I have that. But Im nothing if I cant be me. If I cant be true to myself, they dont mean anything."\r\n\r\nKim took those words to heart and in turn offered Jenner her first bit of woman-to-woman advice: "Girl, you gotta rock it, baby!"\r\n\n\n www.elle.com'),

Her other projects include The Styleliner, a mobile boutique run out of a refurbished potato delivery truck (its stationed at the winery for the summer); a line of handbags; and a baby— shes due in July. Calling from Paris, where she was stocking up on Styleliner goods, she shares a few of the local spots that retain the bohemian flavor she remembers from her youth.\r\n\r\nBASK:\r\nWölffer is partial to oceanside picnics, particularly on mellow Sagaponacks Gibson Beach, which tends to be less crowded than nearby stretches of sand.

(7, 'Fashion', 'WWW.VOGUE.COM', 'Model Kat Hessen Wants to Empower Women, Not Just #FreeTheNipple\r\n\r\nWhen I reach model Kat Hessen by Skype earlier this week, she is at home in Los Angeles, chowing down on a plate of takeout taquitos. You’ll forgive her appetite—the Norwegian-native and Alexander Wang and Chanel runway regular skipped her hour lunch break at her EMT class to speed over to a Louis Vuitton casting on her motorcycle. Modeling may be the last thing on her mind today as she discusses bike trips and big adventures, but—much like when she and her fiancé had to postpone the rest of their motorcycle tour of Guatemala so that she could walk exclusively for Chloé for fall 2015—the fashion world has a tendency to come up.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe willowy, apple-cheeked eccentric adheres to an On the Road–style freewheeling type of life fantasized about by 9-5ers chained to their desks: Hessen is everywhere and anywhere she wants to be, whether that’s cruising up to Canada on a motorcycle to escape a hurricane or joining a relative stranger on a road trip to Florida after her second-ever Fashion Week. “I met this guy,” Hessen says of the man who became her fiancé, “and it was the middle of Fashion Week and he was like, ‘Do you want to come on my motorcycle out to Florida?’ It was February and March, so we both had hypothermia and we were disgusting. We just stayed in motels or with people we met, but it was really fun.” A few years later, they embarked on a trip from London to Africa after they spotted an inexpensive dirt bike on Craigslist. “We thought we could ride all the way to Morocco,” she says. “But we ended up going all the way to Nigeria before the bike exploded.”  They ended up stranded in Mauritania, hitching rides from locals, camping out with a family, and heading briefly to Senegal, before Hessen and her fiancé contracted malaria and staph infections and were deported for lack of proper visas, eventually returning stateside.\r\n\r\nThey recovered quickly and moved to the West Coast, bouncing around makeshift living spaces ranging from a rented aircraft hangar to an ambulance purchased on Craigslist. “We didn’t have a kitchen,” says Hessen. “And we didn’t have any money so we just ate canned tuna and rice. At the end I weighed about 95 pounds.” Hessen enrolled in classes at a community college and an EMT course at UCLA. “When we were sick [in Africa], I kind of felt helpless and I also felt like an idiot. I feel like basic skills are going to become a lot more important. We would meet people and they’d be like, ‘So, what do you guys do?’ We work in fashion. . . .” says Hessen, who recalled a conversation with the matriarch of the Mauritanian family she had met on the road: “[The man we stayed with] was nice to his wife but she still didn’t have any power over her own life. She said to me, ‘The only blessing I have in life is that I don’t have any daughters. At least my sons can be something, they can be masters of their own fate, but as a woman here you have nothing, you don’t make a single decision for yourself.’” You could say Hessen’s newfound interest in medicine is rooted in her determination to be the master of her own destiny. “If I’m going through the jungle on a motorcycle with my fiancé and he gets hurt and I don’t know how to save him, that would be a tragedy,” the model says, “because that is preventable.”\r\n\r\nThat same electrifying obsession with independence is evident in her diamond-in-the-rough Instagram account @delikathessen; a sarcastic, comical array of social observations ranging from a woman using a selfie stick on a ledge that reads “Keep Off” and images of dolls that poke fun at the modeling industry to Hessen’s failures at freight train–jumping in Las Vegas. The one thing you won’t find on the social media outlet? A casting, test, or runway shot. “I think women, in general, we kind of just tell them that as long as you look pretty and upload loads of sexy pictures up on Instagram, the greatest cause of feminism is making sure that you can show your nipples on the Internet. Like, OK, that’s great, but do you know about women who can’t get an education or women who get circumcised when they are two years old? I don’t give a shit about your nipples: Spend your energy on something else. If that is your biggest problem, that you don’t feel liberated as a woman, then you are overprivileged, and you have too much time on your hands I think.” Plus, Hessen’s instagram is personal, she says, “That is the only part [of my life] that is public that I actually get to be myself, and it would be a shame to waste it by posting modeling pictures.” We have the feeling that she’ll be getting a lot more opportunities to be herself soon enough.\r\n\r\nwww.vogue.com'),

Shell give it another try and offer you a few options for how she now thinks shes supposed to pronounce the word. Pick the one that sounds the best, and Siri will use that pronunciation from now on.\r\n\r\n2. Level Up\r\nNeed a level for a quick DIY project at home? The compass app on your iPhone has one built in. To use it, open up the compass app on your phone, and then swipe to the left to pull up the level screen.\r\n\r\n3. Give Better Vibrations\r\nYoure not limited to the same vibration for everything. Go into the Settings of your phone and then select Sounds, Vibration, and then Create New Vibration to tap out your own buzzing pattern. You can name your creation and then use it as a vibration alert for anything youd like. For instance, you could have one vibration pattern to signal that youve received a text and another for tweets or emails. Once youve implemented your own secret code, you wont need to pull your phone out of your pocket nearly as much.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE RECOMMEND\r\nI Let The Internet Make My Life Decisions For A Week\r\n4. Control Your Camera With Your Headphones\r\nArms not quite long enough to get the whole family into that selfie? Use your earbuds as a remote shutter button for your iPhones camera. Simply launch the camera as normal, set up your shot, and then press the volume-up button to snap a photo.\r\n\r\n5. Block Calls From Your Ex\r\nTired of constant calls from your ex or a persistent telemarketer? Block calls from a specific number by clicking the "i" button beside their most recent call or pulling up their contact card in your phone, and selecting Block This Caller from the bottom of the page. Once blocked, you will no longer see texts or calls from that person. If you make up later on, you can unblock their number by going to Settings, Phone, and then Blocked, and removing them from your list.\r\n\r\n6. Put a Sleep Timer on Your Jams\r\nLike to listen to tunes while youre going to sleep? You can use the timer on your iPhone to schedule when your music will stop so that it cuts out soon after you fall asleep. Go to the clock feature on your phone and select Timer. Choose how long youd like music to play as the length of the timer, and then select When Timer Ends from the page. Next, scroll to the bottom of the list of available alarm sounds and then select Stop Playing from the options. Finally, hit Start on the timer. Now your tunes will stop playing when the time hits zero.\r\n\r\n7. Power Up Faster\r\nHave only a few minutes to charge your phone before heading out on the town? Put it in airplane mode to make it power up twice as fast. Since your phone wont have to use any juice to search for and connect to a wireless tower or a Wi-Fi network, it can concentrate on getting charged up. (Airplane mode is also a great way to stretch that last 5 percent of battery life.)\r\n\r\n8. Show the Time Stamp of Every Text\r\nStruggling to remember exactly when you sent that last text (and if its too soon to send another one)? Slide a single text to the left to reveal the time stamp on all of the texts on the page.\r\n\r\n9. Go Undercover\r\nDont want anyone to see when your significant other suddenly decides to send you a saucy text? You can disable the home screen preview for messages so that any nosy screen-lookers see only "iMessage" rather than details about your scandalous after-dinner plans. Disable preview by going to Settings, Notification Center, and then Messages. In the Messages page, toggle the Show Preview button to the off position. While youre poking around, you might also want to toggle off the Send Read Receipts feature. Turning it off means that people who send you iMessages will only be able to tell a message has been delivered, not whether or not youve read it. You can get to it by going back to your main Settings page and selecting Messages.\r\n\r\n10. Remind Yourself to Buy Toilet Paper\r\nThe iPhone will allow you to create a geofence around a particular location, and send you a reminder whenever you pass through its virtual gates. For instance, a fence around your local grocery store can remind you to pick up some TP while you shop, or a fence at the office can be the nudge you need to remember to pass along that project file you keep forgetting. Set up a geofence by going into your phones Reminders app, create a reminder, and then tap the "i" beside it. Select "Remind me at a location" from the next page, and then add the address where youd like to receive a notification and whether youd like to get it as youre arriving at the place or as youre about to leave.\r\n\r\nwww.cosmopolitan.com'),

According to The Guardian, the process, which extracts the persons odor from a piece of clothing, doesnt just rely on his or her signature perfume scent but instead collects the smell of the loved ones skin, hair, and body for a truly unique fragrance.\r\n\r\nApalategui plans to launch the perfume company in September that will offer grieving families at funeral homes to opportunity to create their own sentimental fragrance for $600. Although the focus right now is on bottling the scent of the deceased, shes hoping to extend the service to those who want to capture the scent of their living loved ones in the future.\r\n\r\nwww.cosmopolitan.com'),

Despite the fact that they happen every morning, the wardrobe crises come as a fun little paralyzing and torturous surprise every day. Why? Because somehow, even though my closet is full, I have NOTHING TO WEAR. Here, the 24 things that go through my brain when I get dressed in the morning:\r\n\r\n1. OK, Im going to plan my outfit for today in the shower so itll be the fastest getting-ready day ever.\r\n\r\n2. I should wear something like what Miranda Kerr wore — that camel skirt with perfect white button-down.\r\n\r\n3. I wish I owned a camel-colored leather skirt. Or a perfect white button-down.\r\n\r\n4. Whatever, Ill figure it out when Im actually out of the shower and in front of my closet. Visualizing is hard.\r\n\r\n5. Crapppp. This is all crap. Crappppp. I dont own any clothes.\r\n\r\n6. No clothes, no clothes, like, actually zero clothes. I should really just throw all this out.\r\n\r\n7. OK, Ill just wear jeans and some sort of sweater.\r\n\r\n8. Wait. Why do these jeans feel like theyve just been washed? I havent done laundry in three weeks so they cannot possibly have been washed. But. Cant. Button. SO MANY SEAMLESS REGRETS.\r\n\r\n9. Ill wear a skirt. Will people remember I wore this skirt yesterday? Crapcrapcrap.\r\n\r\n10. OK, Ill just do these effing tight jeans and a biggish sweater to hide the muffin top.\r\n\r\n11. Wait, why do I look so big in this big sweater? Nope, nope, nope.\r\n\r\n12. Hmm, is this shirt too wrinkled? How dark is the office?\r\n\r\n13. I mean, do I even interact with people during the day? Its probably fine?\r\n\r\n14. Do I look like a boy?\r\n\r\n15. Maybe if I curl my hair a bit, Ill look better. Just, like, some effortless Gisele waves to pull it all together. Even though Ive never used this curling iron thing before, this seems like a good idea to try right now.\r\n\r\n16. Oh god, this doesnt look like Gisele. Straightnerrrr.\r\n\r\n17. Maybe a cat-eye will look fancy and distract people?\r\n\r\n18. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Its OK, Ill just wash my face. Should I shower again?\r\n\r\n19. Jeeeeessussss, how has it been 45 minutes. OK, just decide what to wear and it will be whatever and that is fine.\r\n\r\n20. Dont look in the mirror.\r\n\r\n21. Murderrrrrrrrrer. I cant wear this! Have my hips ALWAYS LOOKED LIKE THIS?\r\n\r\n22. Youre fine. Youre great! Just put that first outfit back on and leave.\r\n\r\n23. Great. This is fine. Leave. LEAAAVE.\r\n\r\n24. Wait ...

Here’s what to know before you stock up for your summer BBQs.\r\nKetchup\r\nKetchup has about 4 grams (1 teaspoon) of sugar per tablespoon, most of which is added sugar (aim for no more than 6-9 teaspoons of added sugar per day). There’s not a lot of variation among brands, so choose your favorite. \r\nMayonnaise\r\nThe top-selling condiment in America also packs the biggest calorie punch. Save on calories with low-fat mayo (a mere 15 calories per tablespoon) or light mayo, but be aware that these may have added sugars and starches. For a cleaner ingredient list, choose regular mayo (about 100 calories per tablespoon) and smear on sparingly. \r\nRelish\r\nWhether you prefer sweet or dill, watch out for fake food dyes (like Yellow 5) and look for a jar with 90 mg of sodium or less per tablespoon—some have more than 300 mg!\r\nMustard\r\nBrands span from 30-125 mg of sodium per teaspoon—which is a pretty big range for such a small amount. Squeeze out a tablespoon and you could be looking at 15 percent of your daily sodium limit. Look for mustard with no more than 65 mg of sodium per teaspoon (Dijon varieties tend to be the highest). \r\nOther tasty toppers to try: Load up on the vegetables.

It’s easy, budget-friendly and everyone loves it. Plus I can please vegetarians, vegans, omnivores and even kids without making myself crazy, and the leftovers are always welcome.\r\nWith Cinco de Mayo around the corner, I’m already planning my next Mexican fiesta. Lucky for me (and you!), I have the perfect Mexican menu all queued up. Fresh salsas, melt-in-your-mouth steak, creamy black beans, zesty shrimp and more recipes that seem impressive, but are actually incredibly simple, will line my table and fill my friends’ plates. Huge bonus: Almost everything can be made in advance, so you have little to do but enjoy hanging out with your guests.\r\nThis menu comes courtesy of Mexico City-born chef Roberto Santibañez. He now calls New York City home and cooks up delicious Mexican fare in his Fonda restaurants. The recipes are simple yet packed with flavor. Make the menu and we guarantee it will become your go-to entertaining menu this summer!\r\nHere’s the menu plus make-ahead tips for all the dishes. Just warm up some tortillas and you’re good to go!\r\nGrilled Tomatillo-Chipotle Salsa (Salsa de Tomatillo Asado con Chile Chipotle): In this salsa recipe, tomatillos are softened on the grill and slightly charred for smoky flavor. To vary the heat, use 1 teaspoon of chipotle powder for mild and up to 3 teaspoons for a little kick in the pants. \r\nGrilled Pineapple Salsa with Cucumber (Salsa de Piña Asada con Pepino y Habanero): Habanero chile gives this caramelized pineapple salsa recipe a little spice. If you’re looking to tame the heat, try fresh jalapeños instead. \r\nMake-ahead tip: The flavors of these two salsas have a chance to fully develop when you make them the day before. On fiesta day, let them stand at room temperature for about an hour to get the chill out before serving.\r\nChile-Marinated Skirt Steak (Carne Asada en Adobo de Guajillo): Dried chiles are toasted, soaked and pureed to make a flavorful steak marinade. Toasting the chiles in a heavy, dry skillet is the key to unlocking their flavor (not just their heat). Look for dried chiles in the produce section of many markets.\r\nMake-ahead tip: Skirt steak is best when it has time to soak up the flavors of any seasonings. Make this toasted chile marinade up to 5 days ahead and rub it on the steak the day before the party. All that’s left to do: grill and slice.\r\n\r\nMexican Black Beans (Frijoles Negros con Hoja de Aguacate):  This authentic recipe for black beans uses avocado leaves to add a flavor reminiscent of anise. If you don’t have a Latin market in your area you’ll likely have to go online to get avocado leaves, though it’s worth it. But even if you leave them out, you’ll still have an awesome pot of black beans.\r\nMake-ahead tip: A pot of black beans takes 1 to 2 hours to become tender, depending on how fresh your beans are. Make them up to 3 days ahead and then slowly reheat on the stovetop (thinning with a little broth or water as needed) about an hour before serving.\r\n\r\nRoasted Poblano Chiles with Onion (Rajas):  This chunky Mexican side dish called rajas, which literally means “strips” in Spanish, is a perfect side to grilled steak or chicken and a fantastic taco topper.\r\nMake-ahead tip: Do a little pre-party multitasking: while the black beans are simmering, grill and peel the poblanos for this taco topping. \r\n\r\nGarlic-Oregano Grilled Shrimp (Camarones Asada en Escabeche):  Escabeche, a quick pickling of already-cooked food, is a common way of preparing fish and vegetables in Mexico. In this version, the shrimp are grilled first, then infused with flavor from a chile, herb and vinegar marinade.\r\nMake-ahead tip: You can make the marinade for these zesty shrimp a day or two ahead. Then about an hour before your guests arrive, pop the shrimp on the grill; let them marinate as the party heats up.\r\n\r\nHoneydew Melon Agua Fresca (Agua de Melon Verde):  We’ve knocked back the sugar quite a bit in this agua fresca recipe. This refreshing drink is often a way that Mexicans use up their leftover fruit, so feel free to use this technique with whatever fruit you have, especially other melons and tropical fruits like pineapple and mango.\r\n\r\nMake-ahead tip: Make the agua fresca one day in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://feedproxy.google.com'),

I have a secret to share, one that I rarely admit. I really like hot dogs. So when I first discovered uncured hot dogs (also labeled “no nitrates or nitrites added”), I immediately bought them. \r\nNitrates and nitrites are key in hot dogs and other cured meats like ham and bacon: they prevent spoilage and block the growth of the bacterium that causes botulism (a foodborne illness). They’re types of salts, with nitrates naturally found in many vegetables and converted to nitrites in your body—or in the lab. But I also knew the preservatives are believed to be associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer.\r\nSo these uncured dogs were the healthier choice, right? Turns out most uncured meats still have nitrates/nitrites in them—they just come from a natural source like celery powder. They’re labeled “uncured” and “no nitrates or nitrites added” because that’s what USDA labeling laws require when naturally sourced nitrates/nitrites are used. \r\nAccording to a 2011 study, uncured meats may contain just as many nitrates/nitrites, if not more, than conventional meats. But whether they have more or less might not matter. For cancer, it’s still unknown if the preservatives are the cause or if it’s something else in cured meats that’s harmful. Plus, newer research suggests that nitrates/nitrites may help lower blood pressure and improve exercise performance. To this end, experts suggest eating more nitrate-rich veggies, such as beets. \r\nThe Bottom Line: Pick a hot dog that you feel good about eating—only 5 to 20 percent of the average American’s dietary nitrates/nitrites comes from cured meats. But it’s a good idea to limit them: eating lots of cured meats may up your colorectal cancer risk. \r\nPictured Recipe: Salsa Dog\r\n\r\nhttp://feedproxy.google.com'),

Each family and restaurant has their own specific way of making them. Some are skinny and tall, others flat and wide, and some come nestled together like Parker House rolls in cast-iron pans. Served with butter or jam, smothered with gravy or topped with ham and cheese or a piece of fried chicken, biscuits are as Southern as bourbon, collards and mac and cheese. \r\nEven though my mom has lived in the South for nearly 20 years, she’s never gotten quite accustomed to biscuits. She is in the scone camp. She likes the crunchy, slightly sweet baked good, especially alongside a good cup of coffee. And since she is the baker in the house, I became accustomed to and developed a love for scones too. They are still my go-to coffee-shop splurge, especially at 4 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon.\r\nSo when I was tasked with developing healthy scone recipes for the Test Kitchen section of the March/April 2015 issue of EatingWell magazine, my first thought was, “What’s the difference between a scone and a biscuit?” After doing a little digging, I discovered the answer generally boiled down to one ingredient: eggs. Scones have them, biscuits don’t.\r\nOther than that, the ingredients and process are pretty much the same. Both scones and biscuits are usually made with some combination of flour, baking powder or baking soda (or a combination of both), salt, sugar, milk or buttermilk, eggs (if you’re making scones) and a fat (butter, Crisco, lard). The dry ingredients are mixed together, the fat is “cut in” with a pastry cutter, two knives or your fingers, and the liquid is added until the dough just comes together. The dough is gently kneaded very briefly then cut into circles or triangles and baked.\r\nI followed the same general recipe for our healthy scones, replacing some of the all-purpose flour with whole-wheat and using just enough butter to give them great flavor. Then I mixed in sweet or savory ingredients to make each variation special. The result? The easiest, healthiest and most delicious scones you’ve ever had. Enjoy! \r\nChocolate-Cherry Scones:\r\nThese chocolate and cherry scones are a perfect dessert or special breakfast treat. Feel free to swap out the cherries for other dried fruit, such as dried cranberries, figs or dates.\r\nMorning Glory Scones:\r\nFull of carrots, raisins, pecans and coconut, these scones are as easy to make as a batch of muffins. Pecans were our favorite nut in this recipe, but you could also use peanuts, walnuts or pistachios.\r\nLemon-Poppy Seed Scones:\r\nThese classic lemon and poppy seed scones are for the purist. For an extra hit of lemon and sweetness, try the Sweet Scone Glaze made with lemon juice. \r\nHam & Cheese Scones:\r\nBlack Forest ham, Cheddar cheese and chives make these savory scones ideal for brunch or as a new take on a dinner roll. For a different flavor, try swapping out the Cheddar cheese for Gruyère, Asiago or Gouda. \r\nSmoked Salmon & Dill Scones:\r\nInstead of layering smoked salmon, red onion and dill on a bagel, we’ve created a delicious savory scone with those ingredients mixed right in. You could also try other smoked fish, such as smoked trout.   \r\n\r\nSun-Dried Tomato, Thyme & Asiago Scones:\r\nThis Italian-inspired scone blends slightly sweet sun-dried tomatoes, salty Asiago cheese and savory thyme. Cut it in half and layer with Italian-style deli meats, such as prosciutto and/or pepperoni, pickled banana peppers and provolone, for an easy picnic meal. \r\n\r\nhttp://feedproxy.google.com');

Growing up with a Chinese father, I primarily ate an Asian-inspired diet that included a lot of rice. But on special occasions, I had another option: noodles. And like most kids, when given the choice between rice and noodles, I’d always pick noodles. Noodles, in this case, meant ramen, lo mein, soba or egg and I loved them all—and still do. I was afraid that vegetable versions of my beloved noodles couldn’t come close to my enjoyment of the starchy originals. \r\nBoy, was I wrong. Vegetable noodles are usually lower in calories and, depending on the vegetable, higher in fiber, vitamin C, vitamin A and a bevy of other good things. Vegetable noodles also add a layer of delicious flavor to the recipes, such as a touch of sweetness from sweet potatoes in the Sweet Potato Carbonara. \r\nPlus, they’re fun to make! In the Test Kitchen, I cut pounds and pounds of vegetables into long strands with several vegetable-noodle makers. The Paderno World Cuisine Tri-Blade Vegetable Noodle Slicer was my clear favorite. It easily turned turnips into spaghetti, zucchini into angel hair and made flat ribbons of pappardelle out of sweet potatoes. This model was the best at cutting continuous noodles (other models often cut the noodles too short), plus it was easy to clean.\r\nIf you want to swap vegetable noodles for regular noodles, think about the recipe before choosing your veggie. Root vegetables like sweet potatoes are a better choice if you want the noodles to hold their shape and be able to fill in for pasta, for example. If the vegetable noodles are going into a soup or if the recipe can benefit from some extra liquid, go for a softer, more delicate vegetable that exudes some water, such as zucchini or summer squash. \r\nIf you don’t want to add another gadget to your kitchen, a vegetable peeler—either a regular or julienne peeler—makes fine vegetable noodles too. Make long strips with the peeler, working around the vegetable until you reach the seeds. \r\nAre you inspired to try vegetable noodles? Here are 4 recipes to get you started or experiment with your favorite recipes!\r\nShrimp Piccata with Zucchini Noodles\r\nWith the classic sauce of capers, white wine, lemon juice and a touch of butter, swapping zucchini vegetable noodles for the pasta slashes the calories in half compared to traditional recipes. \r\nPork & Turnip Miso Ramen\r\nTurnips stand in for egg noodles in this ramen “noodle” bowl with a miso-ginger broth. Pork is the most traditional meat, but this recipe would be delicious with chicken, tofu or shrimp too. Serve with sriracha hot sauce for an extra kick. \r\nSummer Squash Pad Thai If your garden is overflowing, this will be your new favorite recipe! Chock-full of zucchini, squash and peppers, this Pad Thai is a beautiful vegetable medley flavored with ginger and garlic. Traditional Pad Thai calls for fish sauce, but if you want to make this vegetarian, use reduced-sodium soy sauce instead. \r\nSweet Potato Carbonara with KaleClassic carbonara recipes rarely feature vegetables, but in this healthy version, sweet potato noodles take the place of white pasta—and we added dark, leafy kale. Other root vegetables, such as butternut squash, carrots and celeriac, would also be delicious. \r\n\r\nMore recipes featuring vegetable noodles: DIY Vegetable Noodle Recipes\r\n\r\nhttp://feedproxy.google.com'),

There’s a sweet flavor and tenderness that out-of-season peas just can’t match. A 1-cup serving provides one-third of your Daily Value of vitamin C and 3 grams of fiber. Lemon-Mint Snap Peas & Lima Beans is a great way to enjoy them while they’re at their peak.\r\nDon''t Miss: More Fresh Ideas for Spring Peas\r\nTurnipsYou may not think of turnips as a spring vegetable, but they only take a month to grow from seed so smart farmers can turn out an early-season crop. If you find baby ones, they’re incomparably sweet and tender. Bonus: They’re rich in fiber and vitamin C. Spring Turnip Frittata is a delightful way to showcase them.\r\nSee Also: Tasty Recipes for Garden-Fresh Turnips\r\nRadishesIf you want instant satisfaction from your garden, try growing radishes. They sprout up fast and you can start eating them in just a couple of weeks. And they weigh in at only 1 calorie apiece, so snack on them as much as you want! If you want to mellow their flavor, try them stir-fried with other vegetables.

And if you frequent Thai restaurants, you probably do too! You can put just about anything in a Thai curry, so we Test Kitchen cooks always keep curry paste on hand so we can whip up a curry with whatever we have hanging out in the fridge. \r\nWhen we decided to use Thai curry paste in the March/April 2015 issue for our Market Pick column (that’s where we do four different takes on one ingredient), we in the Test Kitchen thought it would only be prudent to try as many curry pastes as we could get our hands on. \r\nWe tend to use red curry paste, which is the middle of the road in terms of heat. But you can also get yellow curry paste, which is milder than red, and green curry paste, which is hotter. Green and red get their color from chiles, the yellow from turmeric. \r\nMost large supermarkets carry at least one brand of Thai curry paste in their Asian section. Thai Kitchen is the most widely available brand and the one we primarily use in the Test Kitchen (we analyze our recipes with it). It’s also the lowest in sodium, so you may want to adjust any added salt if you use another brand. \r\nIf you have a shellfish allergy, check the ingredient list—some curry pastes contain shrimp. We tested these recipes with multiple colors and brands, so whichever you pick will taste great.\r\n\r\nWe ended up tasting eight curry pastes made by three companies. We discovered that Thai Kitchen’s red curry paste is milder, while those made by Mae Ploy and Maesri are hotter and have coarser textures—you can see, feel and taste bits of shallot, galangal, chiles and garlic. We loved the galangal-forward flavor of the Maesri yellow curry and the fiery bite of the floral Mae Ploy green curry.\r\nNow that you’re sold on it, what are you going to do with it? We have more than 20 recipes using Thai curry paste, but here are the ones we most recently created. All are delicious and will make an appearance on my dinner table soon!\r\n Green Chicken Curry:  If you’re looking for a basic Thai curry, start here. Try yellow curry paste if you’re not a fan of spicy food—it’s just as flavorful as red or green, with less heat. \r\n Chicken Banh Mi Pizza:  This untraditional pizza is inspired by the Vietnamese sandwich called banh mi. While you won’t find Thai curry paste on banh mi, we think it adds just the right amount of seasoning and spice to the spread for this pizza.\r\n Thai Peanut Curry Noodles: Curry paste delivers a spicy kick-in-the-pants to a bowl of peanut noodles. If you haven’t tried kohlrabi yet, here’s your excuse to buy it. The bulbous vegetable is related to broccoli and Brussels sprouts, but has a more mild, sweet flavor and fabulous crunch.\r\n Shrimp Kebabs with Curry-Coconut Glaze:  Try this Thai shrimp skewer recipe alongside quinoa and stir-fried broccoli.

That report came out last week. \r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough some vociferous voices have criticized the guidelines, well-respected, highly credentialed nutrition experts have also applauded them (see  here, here and here).\r\nI’m in that kudos camp—and here are, in my opinion, some of the most noteworthy conclusions from the report. \r\n1. You can eat eggs. And shrimp. For years, we’ve been told to be mindful of—and limit—how much cholesterol we get from our food. That meant items like eggs and shrimp felt taboo. The logic went like this: dietary cholesterol would raise blood cholesterol. Turns out there isn’t enough science to support that line of thinking.\r\n2. Steer clear of too much sugar. This might not be news to you. And, in fact, we’ve written about the harms of eating too much added sugar here and here. So it’s just awesome that our national diet advice is following suit and warning all Americans to limit their added sugar intake. \r\n3. Cut out refined carbs. Also known as white carbs. This too might not be groundbreaking to you. The health benefits of whole grains are well documented. So let’s give the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) a pat on the back for identifying refined grains as “detrimental” to our health. \r\n4. One diet doesn’t fit all. This is my favorite takeaway. To lower your risk of heart disease and of becoming overweight or obese, the draft guidelines don’t point us to one narrow diet or a combination of single nutrients. Instead they encourage a general healthy diet pattern. How you achieve this diet is up to you! \r\nDavid Katz, M.D., an EatingWell advisor, summed it up beautifully: “It leaves people the latitude required to wind up loving the food that loves them back.… For today, we at least now have recommendations, and the promise of official guidelines, that emphasize wholesome foods in sensible combinations, rather than isolated nutrients—which for far too long have unbalanced our diets, like a tail that wags the dog.”  \r\n5. Consider the environmental impact of foods. Critics have attacked the DGAC’s move on this one, saying they are nutrition experts, not environmental experts. And while that criticism is fair, you cannot separate the topics of what to eat for your health and what to eat for the health of the planet. They need to be considered in conjunction.

In exchange, it would get the money it needs to keep going.\r\nBut instead, the prime minister told parliament that his own counter-proposal, which protects salaries and benefits, should be accepted. \r\nEuropean capitals will not see it that way.

They''re athletes, he argues, and injuries happen.\r\nOne of his colleagues later suggested that if I''d been interviewing the world''s most-decorated marathon champion, I wouldn''t be surprised if they had damaged knees.\r\nNor would I suggest a footballer needing surgery was "too far", the phrase I''d used to describe Mr Lee''s arm.\r\nHe had a point.\r\nProfessional gaming - e-sport - is a huge deal in South Korea. There''s a government department dedicated to its development. \r\nThese gamers are like professional footballers, their matches broadcast - on TV and online - in English as well as Korean.\r\nThe best earn hundreds of thousands of pounds every year: a mixture of salaries, prize money and sponsorship deals.\r\nMr Lee is a Starcraft player for KT Rolster, one of South Korea''s bigger teams. The scar is a result of being at the top of his game for 10 years.\r\nRead more stories from the South Korea Direct season:\r\nWhatever happened to Psy and K-pop''s bid to conquer the world?\r\nThe woman who liberated Korean housewives\r\nIn Pictures: Fish, fruit and veg in South Korea''s markets\r\nHow good are Kim Jong-un''s hackers?\r\nOn the day I visited, KT Rolster''s Starcraft players were training hard to be just like Mr Lee.\r\nThe noise of their practice produced an almost hypnotic tap-tap-tap-tap backing track in a room which resembled the kind of place you''d be subjected to when sitting a computer-based exam.\r\nEach PC in its own cubicle, gamers with their headphones on, the room screamed "do not disturb".\r\nThe difference here is that these cubicles feel lived in. Family pictures, the remains of snacks, and the odd toothbrush. And then there''s the gifts. A lot of gifts. \r\nThe professional gamers are overwhelmingly male, but their most-obsessive fans are female, lavishing the boys with the kind of attention otherwise reserved for the singing K-Pop stars, the country''s other booming entertainment export.\r\nBut unlike the fad of Gangnam Style, e-sports is something South Korea feels it can bring to the world. \r\n"I believe that e-sport has plenty of potential [to be regarded as a proper sport], although perhaps not as much as physical games," Mr Kang said.\r\n"E-sports is in the process of becoming a mental sport like chess."\r\nDown the hallway - and past a room filled with bottles of "sports" drink Pocari Sweat, another sponsor - I found the training room for KT Rolster''s League of Legends team.\r\nLeague of Legends - LoL - is arguably the biggest of the e-sports titles and is all about teamwork and group strategy.\r\nThe team here joked about going out and drinking beer - and teased about who got the most, and the least, gifts.\r\nAs well as training together, the teams live together in some digs a short walk from the training office.\r\nI''d expected a room full of gadgets and other technology. These are big gamers, after all. But no - aside from a TV, there was very little in the way of gaming entertainment.\r\nHere, their charming housekeeper holds fort, and does what she can to keep the team healthy.\r\n"They spend most of their time sitting with little exercise," she said, while washing up, "so I wanted to avoid cooking high-calorie foods, but they love naughty foods like that."\r\nShe loves them, she told me. "They''re adorable."\r\nAt the top-end of gaming, the players are undeniably well looked after, healthy and happy - even if the gruelling routine means they clearly don''t enjoy playing anymore. It''s work. \r\nBut for the non-professional, the impact heavy gaming is having on the health and social lives of young Koreans is of great concern to many.\r\nAfter visiting KT Rolster, I went to another part of Seoul to visit what is known as a PC Bang. They''re all over South Korea - internet cafes, essentially, but with high-end gaming PCs. Hundreds of them, in a big room kitted out like a club - with its own bar. It''s open 24 hours a day.\r\nThere have been numerous instances where gamers have died in these PC Bangs. They are rare, but make global headlines.\r\nSouth Korea has made numerous attempts to curb the amount of online gaming its young are playing. In 2011, it passed the Shutdown Law - dubbed the Cinderella Law - which prevented children aged 16 or below from playing online games between 10:30pm and 6:00am.\r\nThe rules were later amended to allow parents to make their own choice about when gaming access should be curtailed in the home.\r\nThe country is the world leader in treatment for all sorts of technology dependency, but gaming is, by far, the most common issue. It''s one that has parents literally dragging their children to addiction centres set up all over South Korea.\r\nAt KT Rolster, coach Mr Kang is responsible for looking after his team''s wellbeing - but he also recognised the negativity around hardcore gaming.\r\n"When people immerse themselves in something and become addicted to it, then they can cross the line.\r\n"Our bodies might be very tired or in poor condition. These things happen not only while playing games. Even when people work out, some people can have a heart attack."\r\nHe stopped, keen to move on from what he saw as a predictable, perhaps tedious, line of questioning.\r\nDuring my time with KT Rolster my point of view flip-flopped between seeing gaming as either serious business, or a serious problem.\r\nWith the relentless tap-tap-tap of keyboards still echoing in my ears, I came to the only reasonable conclusion I could: it''s both. \r\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk'),

He cited the example of child obesity to make his point, saying if this was not tackled it would lead to a tide of new cases of cancer, heart disease and diabetes. He urged the NHS to "rattle the cage and try something different".\r\nBut he could have chosen a range of other issues from smoking to drinking. The theme cropped up again in a separate debate on the devolution of public spending in Greater Manchester. Philip Blond, director of ResPublica, a think tank which has been looking into the case for change in the region, spoke about his desire to see the health service intervening early to prevent people developing health problems in the first place.\r\nHe floated the idea of GPs being able to refer patients for home insulation as a way of keeping their homes warm. \r\nIt may sound fanciful, but consider this: research shows cold, damp and dangerous homes cost the NHS £2.5bn a year. Not only do they increase the risk of respiratory problems, but hazards in the home are the most common reasons for falls among the elderly. \r\nSome areas have already looked at these things. In Liverpool the council and the NHS have been working together on a Healthy Homes Programme since 2009. \r\nLast year in Sunderland, doctors began offering help with insulation, double-glazing and boilers and started seeing some falls in demand.\r\nThere is also growing interest in social prescribing, whereby GPs refer patients on to knitting clubs and fishing groups, as a way of tackling problems such as depression.\r\nOffering befriending services is another novel idea that is growing in popularity as a way of tackling social isolation among the elderly, which is increasingly been recognised as a risk factor for ill-health and death.\r\nIn health circles, it all comes under the umbrella of what is called "upstream" intervention.  That is to say supporting people before their conditions worsen and they end up in hospital or a care home, which are the two most expensive ends of the health and care sectors.\r\nThis agenda requires the NHS to work with local partners, particularly councils. The big unknown though - as the pressure on the service intensifies in the coming years - is whether there will be the breathing space for it to do so.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk'),
(47, 'News', 'http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-32899264#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa', 'Will Iran transform global energy markets?\r\n\r\nIran is a bona fide superpower in global energy markets. Or rather it would be if reserves in the ground were the measuring stick. \r\nTaking oil and gas together, only Russia can boast of greater riches.\r\nThe potential to be a major gas exporter, then, is huge - were it not, that is, for the small matter of sanctions.\r\nThis rather obvious point is not lost on President Hasan Rouhani, who has wasted little time in repairing relations with the West, with one eye firmly on future oil and gas revenues to help bolster his country''s ailing economy.\r\nHis efforts are very likely to be rewarded in the coming months, as a nuclear deal with the US, the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China that would end sanctions moves ever closer.\r\nIran would then be free, in theory, to flood global markets with huge quantities of gas, offering an alternative supplier to energy hungry nations across the world and dramatically transforming the global geopolitical landscape in the process.\r\n"A deal may not be agreed by this month''s deadline, but it has to happen this year," says Jamie Ingram at research group IHS. "There is so much political will on both sides that an extension of two months could be sufficient."\r\nSuch a ground-breaking deal would bring a swift end to Iran''s enforced isolation.\r\nThe country currently produces about 165 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas a year, of which a little less than 10bcm is exported to Turkey, Azerbaijan and Armenia.\r\nIt also imports gas from Turkmenistan, but cut back last year to the point where the country is now a net exporter of gas for the first time. \r\nConsidering Russia exports almost 150bcm to Europe and has signed deals for a further potential 70bcm with China, Iran''s exports are insignificant on the global stage.\r\nBut the country is ramping up production fast and is set to produce about 250bcm by 2018, according to Dr Elham Hassanzadeh from Iran consultancy Energy Pioneers. This additional capacity will come from the South Pars gas field Iran shares with Qatar, the biggest of its kind in the world. Beyond 2018, there are already plans for many more phases of development, both at South Pars and other fields such as North Pars and Kish.\r\nBut most of this new gas will go towards satisfying domestic demand. The government is keen to reduce the Iranian power sector''s reliance on oil by increasing gas use, in order both to free up oil for exports, generating much needed revenue, and to reduce CO2 emissions. After all, oil does not require huge investment in pipelines or liquefaction to sell abroad. More energy will also be needed to help fuel economic growth that has been hampered by years of sanctions, mismanagement and corruption.\r\nIn the coming years, therefore, Dr Hassanzadeh estimates there will be between 30-50bcm of gas left over for exports each year - a relatively small total compared with overall production, but still a significant amount that equates roughly to Russia''s annual gas exports to Germany.\r\nMost of this is likely to stay in the Middle East. As Dr Hassanzadeh says, "Iran will focus on the regional market - Iraq, Oman and Kuwait. It will reach out to its neighbours first".\r\nIndeed the country signed a gas supply deal with Iraq in 2013 and the pipeline between the two is all but complete. It is also negotiating the route of a separate pipeline to Oman following a similar deal last year.\r\nThe focus will then turn to Pakistan and India. Iran has been talking with Pakistan about a gas pipeline for 20 years and agreement was finally reached in 2010. But while Iran has finished construction on its pipeline to the border, financing problems and political pressure from the US means Pakistan has yet to start.\r\nMeanwhile, India is not willing to commit to importing gas through Pakistan as relations between the two are too volatile, so liquefied natural gas (LNG) would seem a more likely option. While this is certainly feasible, building liquefaction plants takes many years and billions of dollars of investment, and with a surplus of LNG in the world pushing prices lower, particularly with the US and Australia set to increase exports massively in the coming years, Iran may find energy companies willing to stump up the money hard to come by.\r\nNext, attention will turn to Europe. "Iran is keen to set up as a competitor to Russia, so Europe is a consideration," says Jamie Ingram.\r\nBut again cost will be an inhibiting factor. Dr Hassanzadeh estimates that a pipeline to Europe would cost between $5bn-$8bn, and only a consortium of international companies would be able to raise that kind of finance. Again, with international gas prices low, persuading them to invest on such a grand scale could prove difficult for the foreseeable future.\r\nAnd especially so given Iran has historically driven a hard bargain for its gas.\r\n"The main hurdle in Iran''s gas export ambitions has always been price," says Valerie Marcel from the Chatham House think tank in London.\r\n"They need to lock in customers who are willing to pay the price the Iranians want, and without a firm commitment from the buyer, no infrastructure will be built."\r\nCheap global natural gas prices could scupper a deal in the short term, but this has not stopped Iran from laying the groundwork - Tehran has been entertaining international energy companies throughout the past 12 months in anticipation of an end to sanctions.\r\nAnd longer term, the overriding strategic benefits to both sides cannot be ignored - Europe is looking to wean itself off Russian gas, while Iran is looking for diplomatic leverage that would make the re-imposition of sanctions far harder to countenance.\r\nAs Dr Hassanzadeh says, "we are a very ambitious nation", and one, like many others, that is eager to gain influence on the international stage. Its huge reserves of natural gas offer a tantalising opportunity to do just that.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk'),

Some have put this down to a so-called Ferguson effect, referring to the protests against perceived police brutality, that sometimes became violent. Could that be true?\r\nThere are no national figures on crime in the US available yet for 2015, but some cities have released their own figures.\r\nIn New York City, the murder rate has gone up by 20% in 2015 compared with the first few months of 2014. Mayor Bill de Blasio called a special news conference at which he acknowledged the increase, but said it could be contained. He said he had faith in the New York Police Department that they will "turn the tide".\r\nIn other cities, there are similar increases reported. In Baltimore, murders are up 37% and in Los Angeles, violent crime is up by 27% (although murders are down 2%). In Houston, murders are up nearly 50% so far this year.\r\nThis is a term coined by St Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson, whose police officers had been one of the forces dealing with the summer protests and riots in Ferguson, Missouri, following the fatal shooting of black teenager Michael Brown. \r\nHe said in November his police officers had been drawing back from everyday enforcement due to fears they could be charged. As a result, he said, the "criminal element is feeling empowered".\r\nThe phrase was repeated recently by Heather MacDonald, a fellow at the US Manhattan Institute, in a piece for the Wall Street Journal. \r\nThe Ferguson effect, she said, was taking hold across the country "under the onslaught of anti-cop rhetoric". \r\nMultiple police officers Ms MacDonald spoke to told her police morale is at an all-time low and they are now worried about being charged, recorded and assaulted while trying to do their jobs and keep communities safe.\r\n"Unless the demonisation of law enforcement ends, the liberating gains in urban safety will be lost," she wrote.\r\nBaltimore''s police boss, Anthony Batts, said the riots had another effect on crime. Scores of pharmacies had been looted and the surge in the supply of drugs has "thrown off the balance" between gangs in the city, he said.\r\n"There''s enough narcotics on the streets of Baltimore to keep it intoxicated for a year," he said.\r\nThe Ferguson effect is an unlikely reason, said Jeffery Ulmer, associate head of the Department of Sociology and Criminology at Penn State University in State College, Pennsylvania. \r\n"Is it possible that somehow high-profile police shootings have angered some local populations and caused a rise in violent crime of all kinds in the last few months? Yes. Do I find that scenario likely nationwide? No, not at all."\r\nMore likely, he said, is that local forces are at play.\r\nViolent crime rates are often in response to major changes in policing, but are mostly driven by social factors such as the size of the youth population, the amount of socioeconomic disadvantage and social disorganisation in a given city.\r\nViolent crime being up in NYC is related to the decrease in "stop and frisk", said Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\r\nThe New York City Police Department''s historical main tactic for stopping people has significantly decreased after the way it was exercised was deemed unconstitutional. \r\n"Inevitably, there was a trade off," said Mr Blumstein. "[Stop and Frisk] was certainly a deterrent effect to carrying a gun in the street."\r\nNew York City''s historic drop in crime since the 1980s is "astonishing", said Mr Blumstein, but continuing downward trends cannot go on forever.\r\nMayor de Blasio said summer was also to blame - last year saw an uptick in crime at the end of spring and beginning of summer for New York City as well. Researchers from the University of North Carolina found a correlation between higher temperatures and violent crime rates in a 2004 study. \r\nViolent crime is not going up everywhere. Philadelphia has seen a 41% decrease in murders since 2007.\r\nShort-term spikes are statistically unreliable, especially if they come after a long-term decline, and could just be a blip, said Dr James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston.\r\n"It''s a ridiculous silly game of focusing too much on too little, trying to ascribe it to something like the impact of [events in] Ferguson," said Mr Fox. "None of these statistics are reliable."\r\nA wider window of statistics would be much more reliable than a handful of figures representing January to May of this year, he said.\r\nThat flattened feeling police officers are having in Baltimore? It will pass, Dr Fox said.\r\n"I don''t want to minimise the tragedy of so many dying... but the sky is not falling," he said.\r\nSome of the rises in violent crime so far this year are indeed striking, but I understand there have been similarly impressive falls in other cities. \r\nIt is usually a mistake to declare a trend based on a few months of figures for a handful of cities. It is also difficult to blame this selection of figures on a nationwide problem with US policing, or anything else for that matter. \r\nI''m sure the relevant police departments are looking at these figures very carefully, but we will need considerably more data over a longer period to be able to draw any meaningful conclusions.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk'),

It might mark the first time Jacobs'' customers have been introduced to Will Smith''s 14-year-old daughter, but the rest of us already know her as a style rebel-icon for the social media generation. If you''ve been paying attention since her "Whip My Hair" days, you''re aware there''s no shortage of fascinating fashion soundbites.\r\n\r\nMarch 2015: In a recent interview given to Billboard, Smith called her style "high-fashion nomad. I could literally climb a mountain and survive a couple nights in nature. That''s a requirement for my clothes because one day I was on the freeway and I saw a mountain, so I literally just pulled over and climbed it."\r\nNovember 2014: "I like to go to places with my high-fashion things where there are a lot of cameras, so I can just go there and be like, ''Yep, yep, I''m looking so sick,''" she told The New York Times this fall. "But in my regular life, I put on clothes that I can climb trees in."\r\nNovember 2014: "Flexibility with yourself and your looks shows self confidence. You''re willing to paint on your canvas with whatever comes from within you," she told Wonderland.\r\nAugust 2011: "I wear anything I feel like," she told Teen Vogue back when she was a youthful 10 years old. "If I want to put on a pair of Converse with a pencil stuck through them, I will." She also revealed fashion is a constant part of the family conversation. "It''s pretty much a regular family. At dinner we talk about ''What did you do today? What did you wear today?''"\r\nMarch 2011: When she cohosted an episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show, Smith caught flak for being a little bit rude to the talk show legend in the eyes of some viewers. When asked about her closet, she answered back, "Giiiiiiirl. No, it''s like from here to there."\r\nJacobs introduced Smith''s campaign imagery via Instagram, writing about "those individuals whose creativity, unique vision, and voice [that] inspire all of us." He also revealed that the fall ''15 lineup wouldn''t stop with Cher and Smith, with more to come in the next few weeks.\r\n Ever since our first Juergen Teller ad in 1998 which featured Kim Gordon on stage wearing my dress, I have always preferred collaborating with the people who inspire me to give new life to the clothes we show on our runway.

This season, it''s time to kick back and break free from these 12 sartorial shackles—your wardrobe will thank you.\r\n Rule to Break #1: Horizontal Stripes Aren''t Flattering. When dresses, tops, and bottoms fit well, it doesn''t matter whether they come in stripes or solids—find a great cut (like  Girl With Curves did) that fits you and any pattern can be a fun, flattering summer go-to. \r\n \r\nRule to Break #2: You Can''t Wear Shorts to Work. Take a tip from Hema Persad—a pair of long tailored shorts with a boxy blazer can be a fantastic choice when you crave a break from skirts and dresses.\r\n \r\nRule to Break #3: Navy and Black Do Not Go Together. Combining  shades of blue with black—just like Luella & June does here—adds dimension to an otherwise understated outfit.\r\n \r\nRule to Break #4: You Can''t Wear Leather in Summer. Try pairing leather shorts with a printed silk blouse for a chic date-night look—Lovely Pepa''s will take her seamlessly from day to night.\r\n \r\nRule to Break #5: Ankle Straps Aren''t Flattering. If you''ve always wanted to wear strappy sandals but feel like they make your legs look shorter, skip the mini and try styling them with cropped pants or  a midi skirt instead. Kayture''s outfit proportions here are spot-on.\r\n \r\nRule to Break #6: Bikinis Are Sexier Than One-Pieces. You don''t need to wear a two-piece to drop jaws on the beach—there are so many one-piece swimsuits styles available today that would make the cast of Baywatch blush. Look for a diagonal placement print for an extra dose of curve flattery—just like this one from We Wore What.\r\n \r\nRule to Break #7: Store Your Boots Until Fall. If you can''t resist wearing your favorite fall ankle boots, throw them on in the sunshine with a minidress or A-line skirt. It works like a charm on Nette Nestea.\r\n \r\nRule to Break #8: Wear All Your Whites Before Labor Day. White has become season-less, but it''s all about the fabric that you choose. Wear your boxy linen blouses now and save your white shirtdresses for layering with sweaters when the weather gets colder. Get inspired by Hello Shopping''s look and try white and ivory layered texture-on-texture.\r\n \r\nRule to Break #9. Fringe Is for Music Festivals: Fringe doesn''t need to be costume-y. Look for small, refined fringe details on bags and shoes—like the subtle touch on Gal Meets Glam''s suede sandals.\r\n \r\nRule to Break #10. Khakis Are for Dads: Khakis can actually be perfect for a casual date night or dinner with friends. Style them with stilettos and a chic clutch—like Haute Inhabit does. Bonus? Loose pants are super-comfy.\r\n \r\nRule to Break #11. Sneakers Are for Working Out and Running Errands: We believe in wearing sneakers often—and with pretty much everything. Proof: Agoniiya''s fancy black-and-gold top goes great with Converse.\r\n \r\nRule to Break #12. Denim on Denim: Has anyone out there NOT tried pairing denim with denim? What are you waiting for? Try a smart tailored sleeveless top with summer''s staple distressed cutoffs—just like Love Brown Sugar.\r\n See our video for more summer outfit ideas:\r\n\r\nhttp://feeds.glamour.com'),

The hour-long conversation ran the gamut from her Spice Girls audition (she sang "Mein Herr" from Cabaret—"a bit dramatic, but it got me in the group," she says) to David''s marriage proposal 15 years ago ("he asked my dad before he did it, which was very nice and appropriate").\r\nAnd even after a long day of presenting her resort 2016 collection to buyers and press, Beckham had the caffeinated wit and infectious charm of a woman who believes that anything is possible—with a little bit of girl power. Here are the highlights that will make you love her more than you thought was ever possible.\r\n\r\n1. What Her Nickname "Posh" really means: "What Posh actually stands for, is when people used to travel abroad on boats. It stood for Port Out and Starboard Homebut in England, if you go to a nice restaurant, it’s a ''posh'' restaurant, or if you have nice clothes, they''re ''posh'' clothes."\r\n2. Her parents are still crazy in love: "My parents have been together for years and years and years. They’re very happy. My mom and dad still sit in front of the TV and hold hands, which is really really sweet. They''ve always been great parents."\r\n3. Her grandparents kept exotic pets: "I didn’t actually meet the penguin or the monkey...it was when my mom was young."\r\n4. She wanted to fit in at school:  "My dad worked really hard and it was always his ambition to own a Rolls-Royce...So when he got his Rolls-Royce, he used to drive us to school in it every day and I was just mortified. We used to beg him to just drop us at the end of the road. He had a van for work and we used to beg him to take us in the van. How times have changed because I would love to ride in a Rolls-Royce today."\r\n5. Her first atelier was the school bathroom: "I''ve always loved fashion. At school, I used to do a little bit of customizing the school uniform in the toilets at lunchtime." \r\n6. Her first date was at McDonald''s:"He was the first boy to ask me out at school because I really wasn’t popular with the boys. They weren’t interested in me."\r\n7. Her first big fashion purchase: "I bought Patrick Cox shoes when I got my first paycheck from the Spice Girls. They were white slingback Wannabes. I queued up outside Patrick Cox on a Saturday afternoon with my sister."\r\n8. Her backup plan (in case the pop stardom/fashion icon thing didn''t work out): I  qualified to be a dance teacher...because my mom always taught me if I had to have something to fall back on, I could have that. So if this doesn’t go well, I can be a tap-dancing teacher."\r\n9. The original name for the Spice Girls: "We were going to be the Spicy Girls, but thenthere was a porn site called the Spicy Girls. So we had to change it, because obviously that wouldn’t have been very good."\r\n10. The Spice Girls'' message:  "We were five girls that individually weren’t that great, but collectively we worked together and normal girls could relate to us. The message was that it’s OK to be different. That’s where girl power came from. Be who you are, be proud to be who you are, and really value friendships." \r\n11. How the girls snuck away from their first managers:  "We escaped in the middle of the night from the house we were in. We had a demo CD that we recorded [that] Geri hid it in her knickers. We just decided to leave one night and we decided to do things differently. We did our research. We were very impressed with Annie Lennox’s career, so we found [her manager] Simon Fuller. Now he’s my friend and my partner in the [fashion] business. I''ve known Simon since I was 18 years old."\r\n12. On meeting husband David: "Simon was a huge Manchester United fan. He introduced me and David after the gameWhat I really liked about David right from the start is that when all the other players were in the lounge afterward having a drink with their friends, David was sitting with his mom and dad and his younger sister. I really liked that. I’m really close to my family, he’s very close to his and I just  thought that was really nice."\r\n13. How he proposed: "We were in a hotel up north and he got down on one knee and he proposed. He asked my dad before he did that, which was great and very appropriate."\r\n14. On being pregnant with Brooklyn on tour:  "We were on tour in America and performing in lots of amphitheaters...I remember it was really, really, really hot. I was wearing a PVC catsuit and a wig, because my hair was just out of control because it was so hot! I had such terrible morning sickness. And Melanie B too, because she was pregnant at the same time. It was awful, absolutely awful. And then I got bigger and bigger and bigger and I was still wearing that PVC catsuit and platform trainers.  It was quite tough being on tour and being pregnant at the same time. I’d come off stage and I’d say to the tour manager, I can’t go on. What happens if I just say ''I’m going home and I don’t want to do this anymore''? Every night he would say, ''you’ll get sued, get the catsuit back on.''" \r\n15. On walking the Roberto Cavalli runway:  "I remember phoning my mom and saying ''I’m really nervous. I’m walking in this fashion show.'' She said to me:  ''You’ve been walking for 30 years; if you haven’t been able to get it by now, well.''"\r\n16. On launching her first ready-to-wear collection: "We had two models, no stylists. I didn’t know about that. The two girls would just walk toward us and I started talking, because I love talking. People started to like the fact that I narrated through the collections. Sometimes it would be me and a roomful of people and sometimes it would be me and just one person. And even if that person didn’t speak English, I would talk about the collection. Because I just loved it."\r\n17. On fear:  "Sometimes, I really think and I really wish I could sit back and enjoy the moment more, but I''m terrified. It''s not that I want to prove anything to anyone other than myself, but there are lots of things I want to do. And it’s nerve-racking and it doesn’t get any easier. I asked Marc Jacobs, ''does it get any easier? Am I going to feel like this every season?'' And he said ''yeah.''"\r\n18. Who she wants to dress next: "Hillary Clinton...I would love to dress her."\r\n19. On designing an affordable collection: "I’d like to offer clothes to people that can’t or don’t want to pay designer prices. I really want to make women feel great and be empowered. I still want to reach out to that customer.  It’s just figuring out who to do it with and when to do it."\r\n20. What she says when she sees someone wearing her designs: "When I see a person wearing my dress or carrying of of my handbags, that’s really exciting to me.

Right away, handle the straps, making them tighter or looser so that they feel secure but aren''t digging into your skin.\r\n2. Then, manually arrange your breasts by picking them up and pulling them gently toward the center of your torso—they should be fully enclosed by the structure of the bikini top.\r\n3. Finish by checking yourself in a mirror to see if the top is riding up too high in the back or on the sides and make slight coordinating adjustments to the straps.\r\nIf you find you''re rarely pleased with how your curves look in a bikini, there could be a sneaky suspect to blame.\r\n"Padding can sag when it gets wet and takes longer to dry than the rest of the suit," Sarkisian said.

Immediate gratification—that gotta-have-that-now rush—is behind a lot of retail action, but if you''re patient enough, you just might reap the reward of crazy deals. Top shoppers know that scoring big is about a combination of waiting for sales, considering roundabout buying options, and stealthily stalking your target.\r\n\r\nSecret 1: Price Compare. It sounds obvious, but too many people commit to buying without investigating whether the same item is available elsewhere for less. Do it yourself by cross-checking the item at various online department stores or let tech do the legwork. Shopstyle is revered within shopping circles for the way it brings up multiple places an item is listed for sale—including the one that''s slashed by 30 percent.\r\nSecret 2: Don''t Write Off Resale. Consignment and resale sites and apps are having a major moment, all to the benefit of shoppers who now have a multitude of places to shop for preowned pieces that have been vetted by teams of professionals for authenticity and condition. \r\nSecret 3: Be Patient. If you''ve had your eye on a pair of shoes or bag that are classics available season after season, wait out that lusty, must-buy-now moment until any of the year''s dependable sales roll around (the same goes for general items without brand specifics you''re craving, like a pair of leather leggings or a black cashmere crewneck). Department stores typically run a big percentage-off-everything sale every quarter or so; when you see that publicized, get ready to shop.\r\nSecret 4: Practice Your eBay Skills.For buying or selling, eBay is a gold mine of opportunities (we broke it all down to help you get over any apprehensions). Along with pre-loved items, plenty of listings flash the Holy Grail of NWT—new with tags—meaning you can find the same stuff from store shelves at a way-reduced price.\r\nSecret 5: Check Coupons. Coupon-clipping isn''t just for discount-happy types on reality shows: The bargain-hunting tactic is alive and well. Before you buy from any online site, do a quick Internet search with the store''s name and "coupon." You''ll likely be directed to results from Retail Me Not or Coupons.com. The sites have duds but also plenty of money-saving working codes you otherwise would''ve totally miss out on.\r\nSecret 6: Beef Up Your Shopping Tool Belt. Online shopping is a marvelous thing, with new technologically minded shopping aids popping up all the time. Familiarize yourself with them. Apps like Keep track items you want and ping you when the product goes on sale; Shopbop''s heart function catalogs everything you''ve admired, making it beyond easy to browse your favorites and check what''s been reduced.\r\nSecret 7: ABS: Always Be Shopping. The quickest way to not get a deal is to realize you want something and immediately go out and get it. Instead, pro shoppers keep a mental list of things they''re hunting for and keep their eyes open, always. Make it a habit to cruise around the sale sections of any dot-coms or brick-and-mortars you visit because, truly, you never know what gems will be hiding.\r\nMore Shopping Tricks to Know: Meet the Women Making $30,000+ Selling Their Used Clothes A Life Coach''s Advice on How to Make Shopping a Soul-Bettering Experience 7 Tricks of Power Shoppers\r\n\r\nhttp://feeds.glamour.com'),

She also proved to the world that everyone needs a pair of fancy pajamas in their life—stat.\r\n\r\nThough Coddington''s set is meant for evening hours, there''s no reason the tailored look shouldn''t see light of day from time to time.

Look chic without even trying. As evidenced above, a silk pajama top and jean shorts is the perfect summer weekend look—and roll-out-bed-throw-on-pants easy.\r\n2. Pajamas are iconic—in a serious fashion-cred way. Who doesn’t want to feel three parts Audrey Hepburn (think Breakfast at Tiffany''s, Charade, and Roman Holiday) and equal parts Coco Chanel (the style was a favorite of Chanel''s—and she even produced couture pajamas for her best clients).\r\n3. Wake up in the morning and you''re already halfway there. You will never again struggle getting dressed in the morning. Not sure what to wear when you emerge from your featherbed in fancy pajamas? You’re already (at least half) dressed!\r\n4. Versatility, thy name is pajama. If you are, indeed, going to sport the look outside your home, the styling options are endless. Pair the top with everything from a pencil skirt to denim shorts, or throw on a classic cashmere sweater or tuck in a T-shirt with the luxe bottoms.\r\n5. Men have been doing it for ages. This is a classic borrowed-from-the-boys moment: Guys learned the ways of the fancy pajama set long before we did (see: Hugh Hefner, noted pajama lover), and it’s time to try it out for yourself.\r\n6. They''re the perfect summer house look. Lest we forget the summer plans we’ve made that involve tons of communal PJ time!

"Even in very formal offices, you can play without looking out of place as long as you choose pieces that are beautifully constructed."\r\n \r\nMM. LaFleur shirt, $110, and blazer, $195 \r\n1. Play with proportion. The standard suit is pretty easy to sketch in your mind: a classic blazer with straight-leg trousers or a pencil skirt that hits right at the knee. Shaking things up makes everything more interesting while still staying within the safe harbors of accepted office style. Amanda Kraemer, style director at Loft, suggested wearing a cropped jacket over a dress or reversing the equation by pairing a relaxed-fit jacket with a slim, mid-calf skirt.\r\n2. Look for little differences. Some of the strongest ways to add a dose of style are actually the littlest tweaks, according to Nakamura. She suggested trying bracelet-length or wide sleeves, high-waisted bottoms, and center seams that run down the front of dresses and blouses. "Longer skirts aren''t typical office attire, but you can pull them off, especially on a summer Friday. Try pairing one with a high-necked blouse or a super-tailored blazer."\r\n3. Keep an eye out for familiar pieces with modern silhouettes. "I love the idea of choosing classic pieces that have an easy, modern cut, like a dress with a dropped shoulder or a tailored skirt that hits at midcalf, not at the knee," LaFleur said. Take a sheath dress, that professional style building block, and then let designers color outside the box just a bit, whether that means a cowl neck or layered cap sleeves.\r\n4. Prints are totally fine. You aren''t destined to a solid-color closet, but there are some Dos and Don''ts of introducing pattern. "Leave the wild florals at home and opt for prints that are small, graphic, and repeat in an organized way," Nakamura said. \r\n \r\nLoft high-waisted skirt, $60\r\n5. Add an extra layer. If work requires a jacket, don''t stress about figuring out ways to ditch it—make it part of a bigger style statement. "I love the look of adding a longer boyfriend cardigan under a more serious structured blazer," Kraemer told us, pointing out that the additional layer comes in handy when office managers get overzealous with the air conditioner in the summer months.\r\n6. Consider "slightly-off" colors. All the experts we spoke to insisted that you can go beyond black and navy, although staying in the neutral family is wise. "There''s a huge spectrum that looks both beautiful and polished," Nakamura mused, listing plum, burgundy, olive, and emerald as personal favorites. "Even within those shades there''s so much nuance. Instead of a true gray, I love a lilac-gray or a bluish slate. Slightly ''off'' shades feel free fresh without being out of bounds."\r\n7. Make your own suiting. "Don''t be afraid to wear a non-suit as a suit!" Kraemer insisted. Her guidelines for crafting your own look are to pick complementary colors that are still clearly different (i.e., avoid a navy jacket with a skirt that''s a slightly different dark blue hue) and mix fabrics. "Try a textured jacket with a floaty skirt."\r\n8. Finish with playful flats. Many corporate spots will let you slide with shoes that are spunkier than basic pumps. Embrace it, but heed suggestions that brights or prints work better as flats, not heels, and shop for pointy-toe styles in a stripe or bold color.\r\n9. Experiment with monochrome looks. Nakamura shared her favorite stylish office look with us: going monochrome.

First of all, it must be said that those following a traditional Mediterranean diet can rest assured: two portions of vegetables and fruit every day facilitate a natural fibre intake. Cereals do the rest.\r\n\r\n	But if we were short of time, as often happens, and wished to absorb as much fibre as possible in the form of snacks or a packed lunch, which foods could be introduced (surprisingly) to our diet?\r\n\r\n	The following list of foods rich in fibre sets out to provide an indicative and by no means exhaustive answer, to point you fearlessly in the direction of a fibre-integrated diet. \r\n\r\nRASPBERRIES\r\n\r\n\r\n	Containing plenty of vitamin C, water and folic acid, they act as antioxidants but, above all, are rich in fibre. You could take some to work as a mid-morning snack – without any added sugar of course. One cup of raspberries contains on average 8 grams of fibre and very few calories (about 70). Foto: ©Flickr/istolethetv \r\n\r\nCHIA SEEDS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	Seeds in general, and chia seeds in particular, are a nutritional godsend. You can add them to the salad you eat in the office at lunchtime or start to use them in creamed vegetable soups. Fresh chia can also be consumed as a drink.\r\n\r\nCHESTNUTS\r\n\r\n Are you out shopping and in need of a healthy, fibre-rich snack? Buy some hot chestnuts from the nearest stall and you will be sure to get the daily dose of fibre you need to keep fit. They also supply energy and rebalance your intestinal micro flora.\r\n\r\nMUSHROOMS\r\n\r\n We often forget the fact that mushrooms also contain plenty of fibre: 100 grams of mushrooms, for example, contain much more fibre than a slice of wholemeal bread. Amazing, isn’t it?\r\n\r\nAVOCADO\r\n\r\n We will never tire of saying it: avocado is a super food and apart from all the vitamins, its ability to keep cholesterol at bay and its versatility in the kitchen, it is also rich in fibre. Start to add this fruit to your salads and you will not regret it. Foto: ©Flickr/Jaanus Silla\r\n\r\nBULGUR, AMARANTH SEEDS AND QUINOA \r\n\r\nThree foods that have only recently become part of our everyday diet, but which are nevertheless rich in fibre. Bulgur (the processed groats of different types of germinated wheat grain, comprising durum wheat) can provide you with up to 6 grams of fibre. Instead, Amaranth and Quinoa are not actually grains but seeds, seeds that behave like cereals: both have around 5 grams of fibre per portion.\r\n\r\nALMONDS\r\n\r\n Generally speaking, all kinds of dried fruit contain a fair amount of fibre but none of them beat almonds: 30 grams of almonds contain 4 grams of fibre. An excellent snack which, along with fibre, also supplies the body with lots of proteins.   Foto: ©Flickr/HealthAliciousNess\r\n\r\nhttps://www.finedininglovers.com'),

He’s known for taking the street food of his home country, giving it a truly hearty kick and mixing up age old recipes with modern techniques and styles.\r\n\r\n	In the episode he travel back to Kolkata in India to speak with the street food sellers that have inspired his cuisine and try to unearth the cooking secrets they protect and pass on through generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	We caught up with the chef just after his trip to find out more about it and ask him about some of the highlights of his own career journey.\r\n\r\nTell us about the episode, how was it for you?\r\n	I chose my city of Kolkata where I come from, it was a very easy choice, then to cook something from there and go to the archive of what happens there…For me Kolkata is my memory, my nostalgic city, when I get down from the airport the first thing I do is go to a sweet shop and buy these sweets that remind me of back home.\r\n\r\nWhat did you learn from this episode? \r\nI learned a lot about Bengal cooking and the use of mustard, I always thought this was a British influence but actually cooking with mustard is really a Bengali approach and this was interesting.\r\n\r\n	When I was cooking back home I never got that famous and I would go and ask people who I knew how to cook really good food in Kolkata they would never teach me, they would never expose their secrets of dishes in the kitchen but now through CNN and the fame that I have, I have actually got access to the treasure of secret recipes they have. It;s a learning experience for me because in India food is very domesticated, they don’t want to share how it is cooked but just appreciate how it is tastes.\r\n\r\nHow was your first journey home after winning Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants? \r\n	Within three days I went back home, it was like going back and meeting my mum and they were very very happy and then actually I went to a famous restaurant and everybody there said hi to me and it was a little struggle to accept the fame but the funniest thing was that on the way back I was sitting on the airline and this lady said “are you Gaggan Anand” - I said yes and she said, “I’ve been trying to get a reservation for three weeks”.\r\n\r\nIf I gave you a blank cheque, what’s the culinary journey you would love to take? \r\n	It would be Japan for sure and it would really need a blank cheque, I go almost three times a year to Japan and every time I discover something new. I like Japan for the respect and the way they protect things - there are melons that cost $1,000 and $5,000 for a strawberry, I really do need a blank cheque for sure and I would be like a little kid in my Willy Wonka world. The thing with Japan is that even an egg sandwich inside a Seven Eleven tastes really good, I’ve never had a bad meal in Japan, I wish I was born there.\r\n\r\n	The show will play again on CNN International at the times below and we''ll be bringing you clips from the epsiode on Monday.  \r\n\r\nSaturday 6 June at 2030 BST\r\n	Sunday 7 June at 0130 BST\r\n	Tuesday 9 June 1030 BST\r\n	Wednesday 10 June 0430 BST\r\n\r\nhttps://www.finedininglovers.com');

The one between milk & coffee for instance, the same old routine every morning: hot coffee mixed with cold milk, cold coffee mixed with warm milk, lukewarm latte, boiling hot coffee with lukewarm milk, latte heated up in the microwave. Come on, we have to make more of an effort for the most important meal of the day, starting from what we drink: let’s start thinking in terms of creative breakfast ideas. \r\n\r\n	1) The first couple we reommend is a union between vanilla-aromatized black Ceylon tea and milk. To fully appreciate its sweet aromatized accents, add a drop of milk instead of sugar for a beverage you will be dying to dunk your breakfast rusks into. Highly recommended for those who like their morning cuppa to brim with warm sensations.\r\n\r\n	2) If you are vegans, or simply not fond of cow’s milk, try the interesting couple: almond milk and coffee. Having risen to fame for its cold coffee sweetened by the precious nectar, this summer affair can live through the winter on the strength of a nice hot coffee with plenty of body. Dedicated to the more romantic, those who need a touch of reassurance early in the morning.\r\n\r\n	3) A marriage well worth a try, especially on those mornings when you are not quite so rushed, is the one between fruit juice (or smoothie) and natural soy yogurt. The result is a breakfast dish packed with vitamins and mineral salts, neither too liquid nor too sweet, whose soft consistency makes it a real energy-boosting treat, perfect for facing even a cold rainy day. Ideal for those seeking healthy nourishment.\r\n\r\n	4) For a pleasant lazy weekend or a Monday morning that needs to be started on the right foot, what could be better than the most ravishing couple in the world: hot chocolate and cream. A vegan (and healthy) alternative: use the cream obtained from coconut milk rather than cow’s milk, and use water to make up the hot chocolate instead of milk.\r\n\r\n	5) The last breakfast couple to try – or rediscover – is that of ginger and honey. A healthy partnership that will give you an extra boost when you happen to be feeling a bit poorly or out of sorts. A ginger root brew aromatized with a spoonful of Italian honey will help you feel better and keep you warm throughout the morning. For those in need of curative pampering.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.finedininglovers.com'),
(76, 'Food', 'https://www.finedininglovers.com/stories/new-food-domains/', 'New Foodie Domains: a Recipe for Success?\r\n\r\n\r\n	They call them the new domains for foodies: domain names, a website''s extension in letters, dedicated entirely to food and wine enthusiasts. Food bloggers, restaurateurs, owners of bars and bistros, or maybe those who are passionate about coffee, wine and organic products, even skilled and attentive producers or pizza makers. For a few months now, they''ve had new suffixes available to them, with the most popular and in demand are those ending in .Coffee, .Kitchen, .Pizza, .Recipes, .Restaurant, .Catering, .Wine, .Beer, .Menu and .Organic.\r\n\r\n	Soon, however, more will come from the generic .Food (not yet available), with a single and important purpose: to recognize a professional on the internet at first glance, or a site run by experts in the food and wine sectors. The question is legitimate: were the old .com and .net not enough? No. Or rather, not anymore, because consistency is demanded from the restaurateur as concerns that presented on the menu and the food served on the plate. Equally transparent information is requested on the net: users search information, a suggestion - and already create an opinion based on the site''s name. This is valid in the fashion and luxury sectors, and even more so in the food and wine sector where quality and reliability are key and intrinsic features of the service.\r\n\r\n	On the web, a website is equivalent to a business card, or the sign over the store. As such, more and more attention is paid to a site''s web address. In this context, since 2013, ICANN, the international body tasked to coordinate the management of certain internet services, has decided to release a number of new extensions such as the large family of .Kitchen and the like. Among the reasons, there is also one linked to the short supply of .com domains, as well as a technical trick: to be found in the search engines, particularly Google, the rule is to offer a higher keyword density, and having a keyword related to your industry that is already in the site''s extension is a way to gain further hits.\r\n\r\n	Technicalities aside, the sectorial domain name has already become an important piece of technology. In Italy, one of the most important wine consortia that has international visibility, Prosecco, has just decided to register a .Bio domain (the Italian translation of "organic") to protect its brand and strengthen the link between the product and the unique concept of organic production. Many other large companies are following, each in its own field. Another case in point is the domain .Pizza, which despite having a very Italian name and soul, "Neapolitan pizza", lends itself to being rather widespread throughout the world, and due to the international nature of this dish, to be used outside of Italy''s borders. Although it is still early to understand what the future holds for these domains, their debut has been very positive and transversal: they have already been chosen by small local neighborhood restaurants as well as large ones, cooking schools and caterers, street food vendors and food producers. In Italy, where the subject of food is now in the spotlight thanks to Expo Milano 2015, the .bio domain became the fourth TLD (Top Level Domain) in 2015, the most sold in the span of just a few months (after .com, .net and .it). In France, the and the .vin and .wine domains have become the symbol of authenticity and uniqueness of the nectar of the gods - wine - and fight against forgery.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.finedininglovers.com'),

Following the boom of quinoa, the non-cereal we see more and more often on the tables of the western world, in 2015 we shall probably be learning to cook and enjoy teff, the gluten free cereal from Eritrea and Ethiopia, grown in North-West Africa and South-West Arabia. But are you sure to know what is teff? It is a fortunate period for this ancient cereal, particularly now that food tolerance has become such an issue. An ancient cereal indeed since it was cultivated as long ago as 2000 B.C.\r\n\r\n	Teff is officially recognized as being a super food, one of those foods everyone should eat regularly. What’s so special about it? The fact that it is naturally gluten free like quinoa: this makes it a versatile basic ingredient for oven-baked dishes and pasta. But let’s not forget its other qualities: Teff contains great quantities of calcium, iron and amino acids, as well as being rich in protein.\r\n\r\n	Photo: Flickr / Carsten ten Brink\r\n\r\n	Both are excellent substitutes for more traditional cereals; both have a lower carbohydrate content than other cereals (teff: 65 g per 100 g; quinoa: 64 g per 100 g) and are protein-rich (teff: 12 g; quinoa: 14 g). Even from the more banal viewpoint of calories, the two cereals are very similar (approximately 400 calorie per 100 g). Teff is only superior to Quinoa with regard to its content of calcium and iron: 100 g of teff contains around 180 mg of calcium and 7.63 mg of iron; in 100 g of quinoa these values are considerably lower, "only" 47 mg of calcium and 4.75 mg of iron.\r\n\r\n	Teff is mainly used as a flour in Eritrean and Somali cooking; above all, it is widely used for making a spongy type of bread called Injera, particularly familiar to the clients of Eritrean and Ethiopian restaurants. Injera starts out as a dough that is almost creamy in consistency, made from flour and water, which is poured onto a hot griddle just like a crepe. Unlike quinoa, it is not a cereal that lends itself very well to preparing first course dishes, that is to say, cooked in the same way as rice or pasta. Its particles are really tiny so it is perfect as a flour for making bread, pasta and oven-baked products. In other words, it makes an excellent substitute in all those dishes in which traditional white flour is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n	Photo: Flickr / A. Charlotte Riley\r\n\r\n	There is a high demand for Teff in Ethiopia and Eritrea and, in recent years, western markets have also started to appreciate the versatility of this cereal. At present, the greatest European exporter of Teff is Spain. In some countries, it may not be easy to come by in mainstream supermarkets but it is sold in organic food stores or online. On average it costs around 5 Euros a kilo.\r\n\r\nSources\r\nskipthepie.org\r\nTheguardian.com\r\n\r\nhttps://www.finedininglovers.com'),

When you have taken it out of the oven, it is necessary to leave it to rest for 10 minutes at room temperature. This simple step will prevent the ring from breaking up when you take it out of the cake tin.\r\n\r\n3. The use of organic lemons will result in a more assertively flavoured cake with a much more intense aroma.\r\n\r\n4.

I have also added a list of companion ebooks that will give you a more in-depth understanding of the language and they don’t cost anything either.\r\nIf there are kids in the family, you should download either Tynker (Android/iOS) or the Hopscotch app for iPad and they can learn the basics of programming through games and puzzles.\r\nThere’s also Scratch, an MIT project that allows kids to program their own stories and games visually. Scratch is available as a web app or you can download it on your Mac/Windows/Linux computer for offline use. Microsoft TouchDevelop, Blockly and Alice are some other web apps that will introduce the concepts of computer progamming to your children.\r\nOn a related note, the following chart from Google Trends shows the relative search popularity of various programming languages over the last 5 years.

Mobile carriers often charge exorbitant rates for international phone calls but you can Internet based services like Skype or Google Hangouts and call any landline or cell phone number in the world for a low per minute fee.\r\n \r\nAll you need is a mobile phone connected to a Wi-Fi hotspot and some credit balance in your account for making the phone call. You can use these VoIP apps when travelling overseas as well and make significant savings for both domestic and international calls.\r\nNow consider a scenario where you have a mobile phone but there’s no Wi-Fi around and the 3G/4G services are either slow or unavailable. Would you still be able to place calls through any of these apps? The answer is obviously in the negative but there’s at least one app that has figured out a unique solution to this common problem.\r\nThe app, known as Ringo, lets you make international calls from your mobile phone but “without” requiring the Internet. It does so by cleverly converting your request to dial an international number into a local number.\r\nLet’s say you are trying to call someone in Singapore from India. When you make a call through Ringo, the app will internally dial a local number in India. At the other end in Singapore, it will again make a local call to the desired number and will connect these two calls using their own infrastructure. This process is transparent to the end users though it make few seconds extra to initiate the call.\r\nHere’s a chart comparing the voice calling rates (in cents per minute) for all the popular voice calling apps. Ringo not only allows you make international phone calls without 3G or WiFi but it is cost-effective too.\r\n \r\nIn my testing, I found the voice quality good and the app automatically figures out all the international numbers in your phonebook.  Also when open a contact inside Ringo, it will show their current local time and this little detail does help save a trip to Google.\r\nIs Ringo a replacement for Skype or Google Hangouts? Well, yes and no. With Ringo, you do not need the Internet to make phone calls but you still need a local number. In the case of Skype, you do not need a local number but you have to be connected to the Internet. Also, Ringo is mobile only while Skype lets you call telephone numbers from Mac and Windows PCs as well.\r\nRingo is available for Android, iPhone and Windows Phone.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.labnol.org'),

That’s because when you publish a new article, the old content, that was previously hiding in the archives, shows up in the list of related posts and thus gets fresh exposure to both human visitors and search engines. \r\n \r\nMatt Cutts, in 2010 when Google search results were a collection of 10 blue links, recommended using related posts and the advice is still relevant today in the age on Penguins and Pandas.\r\n\r\nYARPP, short for Yet Another Related Posts Plugin, is the most popular plugin in the WordPress repository for display related articles but it does put lot of strain on your WordPress database server. All the related posts calculations are done using complex SQL queries on your WordPress database and that can affect your website’s performance.\r\nJetpack, the official WordPress plugins from the makers of WordPress, now includes Related Posts functionality and it is a better alternative to YARPP for one simple reason – Jetpack runs the algorithms to compute related posts in the cloud and thus put no additional load on your server. Through the WordPress plugin, your website makes an API call to Jetpack which in turn returns a list of posts related to the current post.\r\n\r\nI’ve obviously replaced YARPP with Jetpack for displaying related posts on labnol.org but there’s something I was not too happy about Jetpack. It adds a number of JavaScript and CSS files to the website’s header for rendering the related posts. This in turn increases the weight of the page but, fortunately, there’s a way around that. \r\nYou can use the Related Posts module of Jetpack but without adding extra baggage to your website. Assuming that the Jetpack plugin is already installed on your website, activate the Related Posts module and then paste this code inside the functions.php file of your WordPress theme.\r\nWhat we have done so far is dequeued all the extra CSS and JS files that are normally added to the site by Jetpack and we’ve also created a WordPress shortcode that will let us include the Related Post module anywhere on the page (and not limit us to the end or start of an article).\r\nYou can also set the number of related posts to display in line #27.\r\nNext open the file where you wish to display related posts, most likely the single.php or loop.php file in the WordPress theme folder, and add this line.\r\nYou should also check this page on the Jetpack website for more technical details on how to customize the related posts module of Jetpack.\r\nOne more thing. If you have only recently enabled Related Posts for Jetpack, the related posts may not show up on your website because it may take some time for Jetpack servers to index your site.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.labnol.org'),

(90, 'Fashion', 'http://www.teenvogue.com/my-life/2015-06/unhealthy-excercise-addiction-story', 'What Happens When a Workout Obsession Goes Totally Wrong\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was 16, I joined a gym. Well, my mother joined for me—beyond fronting the joining fee, the state of California mandated that she be the one to sign the paperwork and grant permission that I could go on my own. I was nervous and overly chatty, and sure that this was the ticket to success. Just outside of the sales rep''s office was the answer that had eluded me despite countless diets and many miserable, begrudging miles in gym class. My legs wouldn''t jiggle. I might even get them to not touch. I would finally be thin.\r\n\r\n\r\nExcept that''s not how it—pardon the pun—worked out.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing happened. I trudged to the gym every morning before school, keeping my gym bag stashed in the trunk of my hand-me-down car. I sweated bullets on the elliptical, climbed endless stairs to nowhere, ran my heart out...and did it all again after school, too. I would work out longer, at higher intensities, bought fitness magazines and tried a new routine every other day, and my body changed a little, but not anywhere near how I thought it should. I wasn''t working out that much and that hard for minimal results. \r\n\r\n\r\nOn top of that, I was miserable. My body was exhausted from constantly training, and yet I continued to cut out entire food groups because I wasn''t interested in refueling my muscles properly—I just wanted to lose weight. I would constantly update my playlists to try to distract myself from the fact that I hated every single moment. I started going to the gym at times when I knew there was something I''d want to watch on TV. I woke up earlier and earlier because I knew it would take that much more time to convince myself to get out of bed and actually go to the gym at all. If, as Elle Woods said, "exercise gives you endorphins and endorphins make you happy," I wasn''t buying it. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe live in a world that is constantly touting the new workout class, the new boutique gym, the new way to get "guaranteed results" quickly, that it''s often impossible to tell who is telling the truth—if anyone even is. And between thigh gaps, crop tops, abs of steel, and flattering selfie angles, it''s dizzying to think that we might ever get to a point where we can just be happy with our bodies. It''s not enough to work out—you have to work out and achieve results. Fast.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you''re not naturally inclined to athleticism or on a sports team, working out can feel like a huge chore. Even if you are either of those things, hearing a coach telling you to put in work can drag on your willpower, especially on days when you feel like you''ve hit a wall. "We spend the majority of our days doing things for others—school, work, commitments. Fitness is one of the few things we do that is just for ourselves," says Emily Newman, Certified Health Coach and founder of MOVE YOUR BOOTY. Sure, you might join the track team because your older sister was a cross-country star or to boost how your transcript looks for college applications, but the way to keep showing up to practice after practice is to love what you''re doing, and to have fun. And, unless there''s a weight class requirement involved, few athletes are fixated on making their legs look slimmer or carving up their abs. Instead, they''re focused on performance—getting stronger, faster, better. Not skinnier. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn fact, dieting while training can harm your muscles more than help them. Professionals constantly warn that not eating enough can actually cause your body to hold onto the calories it does receive and stall any results you might be trying to achieve. Yet according to the National Association of Anorexia Nervosa and Associated Disorders, over half of teenage girls have tried to lose weight in ways that could be described as potentially harmful, and 9 out of 10 young women have been on a diet by the time they enter college. I remember trying to cut carbs out of my diet out of my own volition when I was 11, and that behavior spiraled into an eating disorder by the time I was 15. By the time I had joined the gym, I was exhibiting symptoms of exercise bulimia—which is to say, I would purge my body of the calories I was eating by working out. \r\n\r\n\r\nAnd as far as workout tactics go, overtraining is a highly inefficient one, and can actually be less effective than not working out at all. "People quickly forget that your body needs a second to bounce back from those 20 squats and 10 burpees," says Chayanne Joël, a group fitness instructor for Equinox Fitness in New York City. "Our bodies need rest to complement the workouts we endure in order to rebuild and grow. You also need a mental break from the dumbbells and cardio machines." Forcing yourself to ignore a wall might seem like a feat of willpower and motivation, but sometimes, ignoring your body''s signals that it wants to stop isn''t the best idea. \r\n\r\n\r\nAll of this was happening before Instagram, Tumblr, or any other social media platform where shots of tan and taut abs and cut-up fruit can easily overload your feed. "Some accounts post only professionally shot photos of models on beaches with hashtags like #fitspo and #goals. Although these can be motivating, keep in mind these were shot on a professional grade camera, retouched, angled, and lit to appear perfect," says Joël. You can bookmark healthy recipes and shots of athletic, smiling women doing tricep dips on Pinterest, like ever image posted to a hashtag on Instagram, and set up entire Tumblrs dedicated to talking about your fitness journey and reblogging more images along the way—and all without so much as breaking a sweat or getting outside. It''s one thing to collect imagery that might motivate you, but it''s another to lose yourself in a world that makes you feel in any way less-than simply because you are not a fitness model. \r\n\r\n\r\n"If your workout is producing anxiety or coming from a place of punishment, stress or panic, it''s time to reassess the role fitness is playing in your life," says Newman. "The dirty secret of ''being healthy'' is that fun nights out with friends, decadent dinners, and pizza on the couch are all a part of a healthy and balanced life." None of those images are going to show a model''s "cheat meal" because that''s not the lifestyle any brand is selling. In fact, because social media allows the user to be selective in choosing what they do and do not share with the rest of the world, you could be posting a photo of the new Nikes that just carried you through a grueling three-hour workout—and conveniently leave out the fact that you were at the gym long enough to watch a movie on your iPad. Perceived health is rarely the full story.\r\n\r\n\r\nSlowly, I weaned myself off from the gym, and began to run in the park by my college''s campus. I''d challenge myself to run longer—maybe for an extra song or to a landmark that was just that much further—and, to my surprise, I found that I liked running. Not only that, but I wanted to see exactly how far I could go. I signed up for a half-marathon, and trained for weeks with a plan that a coach had mapped out for me. Signing up for a race is a specific plan with a built-in end date, and as much a mental finish line as a physical one. (Joël says that one of the best ways to spur yourself onward is to "create a specific, attainable goal, and make a starting point" from which you can measure that goal.) \r\n\r\n\r\nMy workouts began to gradually involve distances longer than I''d ever run before, and I would typically end them at coffee shops where I''d treat myself to a cookie for having run for so long. (The longer a run, the bigger a cookie, right?) I also began meeting up with with friends who I knew were runners, especially on days when I felt like I couldn''t eke out another mile, something Newman suggests. \r\n\r\n\r\nOver the course of the months I spent training, I also began to notice how my body was changing, too. My legs were looking better than ever and my clothes were fitting differently. But how my body looked was no longer my priority. I wanted to cross a finish line, and a smaller jeans size wasn''t going to help carry me over 13 miles (plus some). And even after I traded what was essentially a two-hour workout for a shiny medal and bragging rights, I knew I''d continue running. \r\n\r\n\r\nI found what worked for me, and though I stopped hating my thighs in the process, it wasn''t because they''d suddenly turned into modelesque pins. Instead, I had grown to appreciate what my legs could do. They could propel me through my workouts, and help me achieve that kind of mental bliss that so many people talk about when they say they need a workout. Endorphins can make you happy, after all—it just depends on why you''re trying to get them.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.teenvogue.com'),

For some, getting punished is not a private matter. It''s for everyone to see, and it''s embarrassing.\r\nAnd now, there''s a story that makes the idea of public shaming even more sad. Thirteen-year-old Izabel Laxamana of Tacoma, Washington, committed suicide on May 29 by exiting a moving vehicle and jumping off of a highway overpass.\r\nAccording to a website her friends set up in honor of her, justiceforizabel.com, this horrible tragedy happened a few days after a video was posted online showing her cutting off her hair in punishment for something she did. \r\nA blogger who saw the video described what happened in the 15-second clip: \r\n\r\n\r\n"It showed a young girl who appeared to be twelve or thirteen years old. She''s standing in a room looking at the phone camera. She appears to be afraid. The camera then shows the floor where there is a pile of long black hair. \r\nA taunting male voice says, ''The consequences of getting messed up? Man, you lost all that beautiful hair. Was it worth it?'' \r\nThe girl stares at her hair on the floor. She very quietly says, ''No.'' \r\n''How many times did I warn you?'' \r\nShe almost inaudibly says, ''Twice.'' \r\nHe then says, ''Okay.'' as if he has proved a point. The video ends."\r\nIn a Google+ post last year, Izabel expressed loneliness and not fitting in at school. For someone who was most likely already feeling depressed and anxious, a public shaming of this sort would only add to those negative feelings.\r\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide is the third leading cause of death for people between the ages of 10-24. A nationwide survey of high school students found that "16 percent of students reported seriously considering suicide, 13 percent reported creating a plan, and eight percent reporting trying to take their own life in the 12 months preceding the survey." \r\n\r\n\r\nThose numbers are scary, and while there are many different things that contribute to suicidal thoughts, it''s important to be aware of stories like Izabel''s so that we can prevent others like hers in the future. It''s time to put an end to public-shaming. Parents and adults are always speaking out against bullying, but don''t they realize this is exactly what they''re doing to their kids when they do this?\r\nWe hope that Izabel''s story can serve as a wake-up call for those who think punishing their kids online is the way to go. Perhaps Izabel''s "lesson" can be the ultimate lesson for parents.\r\nIf you or someone you know is depressed, please click here for resources, or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).\r\n\r\nhttp://www.teenvogue.com'),

To promote Make Up For Ever''s "Be Bold. Be Unexpected.

We think the collaboration is a great fit for both personalities, and we can''t wait to see the different ways each of the ambassadors will get creative with the brand''s upcoming makeup launches. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBesides, after years of experimenting with beauty products and learning first-hand tips from the biggest artists in the biz, Jamie''s quite the natural when it comes to makeup. Below, she shares her four favorite tricks—specifically geared for Asian facial features:\r\n\r\n\r\nFocus on your cheekbones. "Many Asian women naturally have these amazing, high cheekbones. No matter your face shape, you can accentuate them use a bright blush like the Make Up For Ever Sculpting Blush in #22 and apply it about two inches away from your nose towards the middle of your cheek," says Jamie. "I found that starting the blush any closer to your nose shortens your facial features. Next, apply a little bit of bronzer just below your cheekbone and a touch of shimmery golden higher to the apples. No crazy contouring necessary—that''s all it takes to make your cheek bones pop."\r\n\r\n\r\nTry a bold red lip. "Red lips look particularly great on fair complexions. Prep your lips by patting on a touch of your foundation with a sponge—it helps bind the color to your lips so it lasts all day long. Always try to use a lipstick brush to first outline your lips with the lip color then fill them in with the same brush. It gives you better control over the application and creates that clean, crisp line," says Jamie. \r\n\r\n\r\nFill in your eyebrows. "Many Asians tend to have eyebrows that are more sparse. Filling them in is a simple step that really brings great definition to your facial features. Make Up For Ever Aqua Brow is a creamy gel that glides on really naturally. Just use an angled eyebrow brush and apply a tiny amount of product to the base line of your brow with small, even strokes in the same direction your eyebrow hairs grow.

The body governing football has faced appalling allegations that suggests it is absolutely riddled with corruption.\r\nLast year''s summit in Brussels\r\n"And (Sepp) Blatter''s resignation this week presents an opportunity to clean up the game we love. It is also an opportunity to learn a broader lesson about tackling corruption.\r\n"Just as with FIFA, we know the problem is there, but there is something of an international taboo over pointing the finger and stirring up concerns. At international summits, leaders meet to talk about aid, economic growth and how to keep our people safe. But we just don''t talk enough about corruption.\r\n"This has got to change. We have to show some of the same courage that exposed FIFA and break the taboo on talking about corruption."\r\n"Corruption is the cancer at the heart of so many of the problems we face around the world today," Mr Cameron said, adding that corruption "doesn''t just threaten our prosperity, it also undermines our security." \r\n"Football is beginning a long journey to rid itself of corruption and it will take time, courage and determination to see through the reforms that FIFA needs. I believe world leaders must show the same courage and determination to tackle corruption around the globe. That will be my mission tomorrow at the G7 and in the months and years ahead."\r\nMr Cameron will join US President Barack Obama, French President Francois Hollande, Italian PM Matteo Renzi, Canadian PM Stephen Harper and Japanese PM Shinzo Abe for the two-day gathering, hosted at Schloss Elmau in the Bavarian Alps by Germany''s Chancellor Angela Merkel.\r\nMrs Merkel has put climate change and sustainable development at the top of the agenda for the annual summit of the world''s leading industrialised economies beginning on Sunday, which will also focus on growth, security and the threat from terrorism and disease epidemics.\r\nBut Mr Cameron will argue that the issue of corruption - which he put at the heart of the UK''s agenda for its presidency of the body in 2013 - has a bearing on all these areas and must be discussed openly as part of the debate.\r\nHe will cite World Bank estimates that corruption adds 10% to business costs worldwide, with $1tn (£650bn) paid in bribes every year.\r\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) believes corruption costs around 5% of global GDP annually, while in developing countries it can add 25% to the cost of procurement, Mr Cameron will say.\r\nSeven of the 10 most corrupt countries in sub-Saharan Africa are also in the bottom 10 on the human development index and infant mortality is twice as high in countries with the most corruption as in those with the least.\r\nMr Cameron will say that there is an onus on world leaders to do what they can to tackle the issue, and will call for action in the coming months to focus the efforts of the various international organisations tasked with combating corruption and ensure that they are working effectively with one another.\r\nAnti-corruption measures should be at the heart of the new United Nations development goals for the coming 15 years due to be agreed in September, he will say.\r\nDemonstrations over climate change, wealth inequality and the proposed Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) US/EU free trade deal are expected outside the heavily guarded G7 venue, with a protest camp set up in the nearby town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen and around 35,000 attending a pre-summit rally in Munich on Thursday.\r\n\r\nhttp://news.sky.com'),

Having won Europe’s blue riband competition twice in three years under Pep Guardiola in 2009 and 2011, the Catalan club threatened to take ownership of the trophy until their coach decided to take a time out.\r\nHere on Saturday, after the relatively fallow years of the late Tito Vilanova and Gerardo Martino, coach Luis Enrique has the opportunity to underline the generally accepted feeling that Barcelona — the Barca of Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar — are once again the greatest club side in the world. From that point of view, failure is not an option.\r\n‘We have an amazing team,’ said Barcelona defender Gerard Pique. ‘We have one of the best teams in the history of our club. This game is something we have been working towards all season and we are not in the mood to fail now.’\r\n3 - A goal would see Lionel Messi become the first player to score in three Champions League finals\r\n6 - Juventus players who have covered more ground in Europe this season than Barca’s most active player, Neymar\r\n2 - All but two of Barca’s 28 Champions League goals have been scored from inside the box — six of Juve’s 16 strikes have been from distance\r\n6 -Juventus have lost five European Cup/CL finals — level with Bayern Munich and Benfica — defeat tonight would set a new record\r\nA month ago, neutrals would perhaps have hoped for a Barcelona-Real Madrid final. Seeing el clasico as a roadshow certainly would have been something. In ending that story at the semi-final stage, however, Juventus showed that they will provide Barcelona with something more than a lesson in obduracy on what promises to be a stiflingly hot evening.\r\nIn the first leg in Turin in particular, Massimiliano Allegri’s team unsettled Real with their direct and energetic counter-attacking play. Carlos Tevez, who won and scored a penalty, appeared young again while Arturo Vidal and Claudio Marchisio provided a midfield platform that will be fundamental if Juventus are to see enough of the ball in key areas.\r\n‘We will expect to have the ball and control possession and they will counter-attack,’ added Pique. ‘They have a lot of power up front and some good midfielders who are strong and go box to box.\r\n‘They are an Italian team but they always want to play with the ball. They showed that against Madrid and will try and do the same to us.’\r\nSitting alongside Pique at last night’s Barcelona press conference was the Brazilian, Neymar. His verbal offerings were nothing like as expansive as his work on the field but he did cast the trophy a covetous glance as he walked into the room.\r\n‘This is the most important match of my life,’ he said. ‘It has been a dream since I was a child to win this cup. Leo (Messi) and Luis (Suarez) are two extraordinary players and I am just lucky to play with them and learn from them.’\r\nJuventus, it seems, know their place ahead of the final but, equally, the role of underdog is not one that sits particularly well with the two-time winners of the competition.\r\n‘We know we are one step below Barcelona but this is only one game so the difference is reduced,’ said defender Leonardo Bonucci.\r\n‘We are not here to be sacrificial lambs or victims. Juventus have always had a reputation for great players, great champions, many trophies, and that makes us aware of what we have to live up to. This is a club that wins things.’\r\nThe first time Juventus won the European Cup, of course, was in 1985. Recently the club, along with Liverpool, marked the 30-year anniversary of a match — and a disaster — at Heysel Stadium that claimed 39 lives.\r\nOn Friday coach Allegri and his players struck the appropriate tone. ‘It is very important,’ said Allegri. ‘Thirty years ago we saw a tragedy which is going to stay with us and has gone down in the history of football. So I think for Juventus, for Italian fans and for world football, this year is a year to be remembered. Most importantly, we have to think about the families of the victims.’\r\nOn the field, Allegri will miss his defensive rock Giorgio Chiellini, absent with a calf injury. That at least saves us from the sideshow of a reunion with his World Cup assailant, Suarez. There is, of course, still the prospect of Suarez’s reunion with Juventus’s former Manchester United left back Patrice Evra to think about.\r\nIt is to be hoped that storyline does not break the surface of what could be an absorbing game. The Olympiastadion is a venue worthy of a classic and we could get one.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk'),

But even with this group of players now I believe if everyone was fit in the season we would have a great opportunity of competing for the Premier League.\r\n''This team has come on a lot over the last few years and if we can get off to a good start next season we will challenge.\r\n''The club is in a good place. They don''t have to let players go and we''re building on this team rather than players leaving and you have to rebuild around those left. It is a nice feeling and means that the group can stick together. The understanding is there already so it can only get stronger.''\r\nAsked about switching from his wide role to a central position, as he does for Wales, he added: ''That''s my favourite position and where I play my best football. I''m very happy playing back in the middle for Wales. I had a chat with him (Wenger) a few times and he said it was temporary (out wide).\r\n''It means I can time my runs into the box better. When you''re wide you''re taught to try and get in at the far post so the ball doesn''t go straight across. From that central position you can use your instinct where to go rather than just try and get in at the far post.'' \r\n\r\nAs a collective, Arsenal''s chances next season will surely be enhanced by finishing third this time, thereby ensuring they miss the sapping extra work of a Champions League qualifier. \r\nRamsey added: ''At the beginning of the season you''re still getting your fitness levels up and those first few games are quite tough. If you sandwich a few Champions League fixtures in between them that''s maybe too much for certain players at that time of the season. \r\n''So it''s important to go through to the group stages without having that knock-out game to qualify. It''s a good thing for us not to have those games and hopefully get us off to a very strong start.''\r\nIt''s been another impressive season for Ramsey for club and country with Arsenal winning the FA Cup and Wales topping their European Championship qualification group.\r\nBut the 24-year-old does not believe he reached the levels of the previous campaign when he scored a career-best 16 in 34 matches. His hope is that next season he will be given more of an opportunity in the central role he plays for Wales.\r\nTalking at an event with Vauxhall, the Wales team sponsor, Ramsey said: ''Last season was one of those seasons where everything just clicked in. I was top of the stats for a quite a lot of things and to be in that sort of form is quite special.\r\n''This season I think I''ve done pretty well but I''ve been injured a few times - and not just in one block. It''s been a bit stop-start and you don''t get consistently stronger every game. Getting back to full fitness, playing well and then breaking down again is quite mentally draining but I''m doing all right at the moment.''\r\nWales next face Belgium, knowing that a win or draw would leave them brilliantly placed to qualify for a major championship since 1958.\r\nRamsey said: ''Belgium are a brilliant team with so many world-class players who can hurt you all over the pitch. You don''t become the second-best team in the world rankings for no reason.\r\n''But we''ve had two good results against them away from home. We''ve had some good performances against them and we know what we''re about and what we''re up against. We''re confident, we''re at home and a sell-out for the first time in quite a while so it''s an exciting game to be involved in.''\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk');

The fact that it does owes to cycling''s governing body, the UCI, tinkering with the rules in the late 1990s, when they banned some bikes and outlawed certain riding positions . . . after they had been used to break the record.\r\nThus, Chris Boardman''s 35.03miles (56.375km), set in 1996, is the furthest any cyclist has ridden in an hour, but it isn''t the mark that Wiggins will be trying to beat.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstead it is the 32.89miles (52.937km), set in Manchester in late April by another British rider, Alex Dowsett, that stands as the official record.\r\nWiggins being Wiggins, however, he is looking beyond that — and he dreams of the distance covered by Boardman using the extreme and now banned ''Superman'' position.\r\n''In my head, Chris still holds the record,'' said Wiggins this week as he looked ahead to what he says will be the first act in a three-part finale. The second will be the World Championships in London next March, with his farewell coming at the Rio Olympic Games. He insists, therefore, that Sunday will be his one and only attempt at the hour record. \r\n\r\n\r\nIt was only in October that he began thinking about it, when the UCI decided on a clear set of rules for the hour. It inspired a glut of attempts.\r\nJens Voigt set a new mark, swiftly bettered by Matthias Brandle, then Rohan Dennis and Dowsett. There were also failed attempts along the way by Jack Bobridge and Thomas Dekker.\r\nWiggins has been training in Majorca, and it was there that he spoke to Boardman to seek his advice. He wanted to know: ''Am I an idiot for going for it?''\r\n\r\n\r\nBoardman reassured him — ''He said it will either be the best thing I ever do or the worst thing.''\r\nThat aspect of the record is unchanged: there is no second prize, only success or failure. Some 6,000 fans — tickets sold out in 30 minutes — will be there to see Wiggins, and only Wiggins.\r\nHe will try not to think about that. ''It''s going to be different when the stadium''s full. It''s easy when the velodrome''s empty.\r\n''In some ways I wish I''d done it behind closed doors. It''s a bit like a wedding. There are people you don''t want to invite but have to invite, and you end up in the last few days thinking, "We can''t have him sitting next to him because they''ll end up arguing".''  \r\n\r\n\r\nHe hopes to be inspired by the crowd but not too distracted from the task in hand, which is to ride the 250-metre laps in 16.2sec. And then repeat — about 220 times (he hopes).\r\nInfamously, the hour record is a horrible undertaking — one that ex-holder Graeme Obree has compared to a near-death experience and a kind of ''man-made Everest'' that left the world''s greatest ever cyclist, Eddy Merckx, unable to walk for several days.\r\nYet Wiggins, as he looked ahead, did not seem like a man facing a brutal punishment. He was relaxed, happy and supremely confident that he will beat Dowsett''s mark, and perhaps get close to Boardman''s.\r\n''If I could''ve spent my whole career doing this, I would,'' said the 2012 Tour de France winner. ''There''s nothing to worry about — is your team-mate going to attack or whatever . . . It''s so simple. It''s the purest form of cycling.''\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk'),

Champions League win can erase the years of pain\r\n\r\nFor Roy Hodgson, it was the sheer scale and sense of history oozing from Juventus which left the deepest impression.\r\nFor Liam Brady it was the style, standards and a little glamour. ‘Like Arsenal, they had a special way of doing things,’ said Brady.\r\n‘They stood for tradition and class. They had the attachment to the Agnelli family who were like Italian aristocracy. They were the Old Lady of Italian football.\r\nScroll down for video \r\n‘They had fans all over Italy and a history of winning trophies. I remember asking a team-mate about bonuses for coming second and third and he said there are none. You have to finish first.’\r\nAnd they did. Brady moved from Highbury to Juventus in 1980 and won Serie A twice. He was a darling of the Juventini and still is, having scored the penalty which clinched their 20th Scudetto despite knowing he was about to be sold to make way for Michel Platini.\r\nEngland manager Hodgson coached rivals Inter Milan. ‘What struck me was the vast number of supporters’ clubs they had,’ said Hodgson. ‘Inter had thousands all round the country but Juventus had more. They were an institution with success comparable to Liverpool in their glory period or Manchester United more recently. They even survived after the calciopoli (match-fixing) scandal.’\r\n\r\nUnder Massimiliano Allegri, Juve have just won their fourth successive Scudetto, 17 points clear of Roma, and can equal an Italian record if they make it five. They also won the Italian Cup, completing their first Double since the days of the great Marcello Lippi. ‘Win the Scudetto? There’s the Champions League,’ Lippi said. ‘Win the Champions League? There’s the Inter-Continental Cup. Win the Inter-Continental Cup? There’s the Scudetto to win again. There’s little time for celebration.’\r\nThis quotation is writ large beside the glittering trophy room in the club’s J-Museum, and rings true as eyes turn to Berlin for Juve’s first European final in 12 years. \r\n‘The past is not forgotten in Italy,’ said Hodgson, familiar with grainy footage of John Charles or clips of Zinedine Zidane and Platini in the black-and-white kit originally modelled on the Notts County strip.\r\nMost consider it a step too far to beat Barcelona but Juventus are proud of the depth of their desire and spirit. Former president Gianni Agnelli once said: ‘In difficult moments I appeal to something in my subconscious. The ability never to give in. This is why Juve win. Even when you do not expect it.’\r\nRivals may smile and mention power, corruption and scandal.\r\nAsk a rival fan about this history of triumph against the odds and they will insist officials are swayed by the political influence of the Agnellis, original owners of the Fiat motor company.\r\nControversy has never been far from Juve’s door. There was a three-year trial into claims of doping covering a four-year period during the Lippi era (coach from 1994-99 and 2001-04).\r\n\r\nThe next big case, calciopoli, took Juventus down, literally.\r\nGeneral manager Luciano Moggi was found to have tried to influence the appointment of referees and Juve were relegated to Serie B and stripped of two Serie A titles (for 2005 and 2006).\r\nJuventus always protested that the issue was an injustice based on jealousy and are still fighting for damages. But suspicion remains and Juve are still adored and detested in equal measure.\r\nThe Juventus Stadium, opened in 2011, is privately owned — a rarity in Italy — and generates huge match-day profits, giving Juve an edge at a time of financial fair play.\r\nThe 41,000-seat arena generates a vibrant atmosphere distinct from that of its soulless cavern of a predecessor, the Stadio delle Alpi. Plastered everywhere is the figure 33, the Serie A titles won — a total that includes the two lost to calciopoli.\r\nAlso representing the future is a name from the past. Andrea Agnelli, 39, was appointed president in 2010, the son of former president Umberto and a nephew of Gianni.\r\nJohn Foot, author of Calcio: A History of Italian Football, said: ‘He has transformed the club. The stadium gave them a massive advantage and some of the signings have proved ridiculously good, like Paul Pogba and Andrea Pirlo. It’s not long since their marquee signing was Nicklas Bendtner.’\r\nPerhaps the most inspired decision was to select Antonio Conte, captain under Lippi, as coach. Until leaving to manage Italy in 2014 Conte instilled traditional Juve values into a team with a solid defensive base.\r\n‘That was always the style,’ said Brady. ‘Get the defence right and then have players who make the difference up front. We’re all looking at Messi but you never write off an Italian team in a final.’\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk'),

One step up from a training game, this was all about the Scotland manager seeing some of his star performers shake off any staleness that’s crept in since the end of their respective domestic seasons.\r\nQatar made for decent if hardly dynamic opponents. Crucially for Strachan ahead of Dublin, they never lost sight of the friendly nature of the contest.\r\n\r\nScotland: Marshall (Gordon 45), Forsyth, Greer, Mulgrew, Maloney (Adam 60), Brown (D Fletcher 60), McArthur (Morrison 45), Anya, Ritchie, Naismith (Griffiths 59), Forrest (Russell 74).

Keeper David Marshall was one of five English Championship players given a much-needed run-out after a five-week break from competitive action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all the talk of protests over the choice of opposition, there was precious little evidence of it last night. The crowd inside Easter Road may have been modest but is was some way from embarrassing.\r\nForsyth, the Derby defender, showed no signs of ring-rust from his end-of-season hiatus with an explosive dart up the flank that immediately exposed the fragility of the visiting defence. Ritchie’s snap shot was blocked by an outstretched Qatari leg.\r\nRanked 99th in the world, Qatar evidently have some work to do if they are to be worthy hosts of the World Cup in 2022.\r\nThey largely relied on set-plays to trouble the Scots. Skipper Hassan Khalid H Alhaydos did sting Marshall’s palms with a meaty free-kick from distance after Brown had been harshly penalised but the Cardiff man watched it all the way.\r\nStrachan will have been pleased with the manner in which his side manipulated the ball in tights areas. The inter-play between Maloney, Forrest and Naismith, in particular, will have had the Irish taking note.\r\nYet it was the driving runs of Forsyth down the left that were the most productive outlets. Naismith was next to benefit from one of his cut-backs, forcing Lecomte Claude Amine to produce a fine low save to his left.\r\nThe Everton man was foiled by the Qatari keeper again at the midway point in the first half after a fine pass by Forrest, with Amine this time flicking the ball from under his bar.\r\nThe traffic remained largely one-way. Anya ghosted off the right flank and arrowed a shot just wide of the far post, then Mulgrew glanced a header a yard wide from a corner.\r\nYet another Forsyth surge to the by-line invited Ritchie to try his luck on the volley but his effort was into the turf and, in any event, off target.\r\nMaloney was next to hold his head in his hands. Sent clear on goal after a Qatari error, the Chicago Fire striker’s hopes of lashing home the opener were thwarted by a quite brilliant tackle by Ahmed Yasser M Abdelrhman.\r\nFollowing a brief interruption to dispense with a professional attention seeker – also known as a streaker – Scotland claimed the goal their efforts in the opening 41 minutes had more than deserved.\r\nNaismith drove from deep until his attempts to penetrate the Qatari box were blocked off by a roll call of defenders.\r\nRitchie motored onto the loose ball and claimed his first international goal with a clean strike into the bottom corner from 16 yards.\r\nNaismith was a post’s width away from doubling the advantage on the cusp of half-time after McArthur’s clever ball over the top but Lady Luck again shunned him.\r\nCraig Gordon and James Morrison replaced Marshall and McArthur respectively at the break, while Naismith’s frustrations in front of goal continued with a header and a shot into the side-netting.\r\nOf far greater significance, however, was the fact he was able to get up and walk after a nasty looking collision with the Qatari keeper that had the Leith crowd momentarily fearing the worst.\r\nDarren Fletcher, Leigh Griffiths and Charlie Adam were afforded just over half an hour, with Naismith, Brown and Maloney sacrificed.\r\nIn truth the score was something of a travesty. Forrest became the latest man in white to rue his poor finishing when he launched a Ritchie knock-down high over the top. The key area for improvement a week today is pretty obvious for all.\r\nQatar showed a little more ambition after the break. Indeed, were it not for a fine saving tackle by Anya, Abdelkarim Hassan A Fadlalla, their wandering left-back, would have levelled the score. Gordon denied the same man moments later with a smart block from close range.\r\nThe introduction of Johnny Russell for Forrest on 74 minutes was Strachan’s sixth swap of the night.\r\nRussell was denied a second for the Scots by the giant arm of the Qatari keeper with the spadework on the flank coming from Morrison, while Griffiths had a late, late effort ruled out for offside.\r\nDespite the lack of goals, it was not an exercise completely without its merits.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk'),

The state authorities also said they found the flavouring MSG, which must be labelled if it is used in production.\r\nState governments throughout the country then began carrying out tests of their own. According to the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, a further two states have also confirmed the presence of lead and MSG in samples collected.\r\nWhile Nestle has repeatedly insisted Maggi is safe – and apparently questioned the validity of the state''s tests behind closed doors in discussions with the FSSAI – the immediate impact on Nestle''s reputation in India has been startling.\r\n"Detection of lead in a food product as a heavy metal contaminant beyond permissible levels renders the food product unsafe and hazardous," the FSSAI insisted today. The body required Nestle to pull all nine varieties of Maggi noodles from the shelves.\r\nIn fact, Nestle had already initiated a voluntary recall. The company conceded consumer trust has been dented and said it is pulling products from the shelves until the "confusion" surrounding Maggi''s safety can be clarified.\r\n"The trust of our consumers and the safety of our products is our first priority. Unfortunately, recent developments and unfounded concerns about the product have led to an environment of confusion for the consumer, to such an extent that we have decided to withdraw the product off the shelves, despite the product being safe," the company said in a statement. "We promise that the trusted Maggi noodles will be back in the market as soon as the current situation is clarified."\r\nSpeaking during a press conference in India, CEO Paul Bulcke – who has flown in to try to contain the situation – reiterated his belief Maggi noodles are safe. The issue, he suggested, was one of communication – with both the authorities and consumers.\r\nThe fact Bulcke has swept in to contain the damage speaks to how seriously Nestle is taking the situation. He insisted Nestle remains committed to India, highlighting how the company has operated in the market for a considerable period of time. "Nestle has been in India for 100 years. Nestle is part of India," he told reporters.\r\nNestle said it was "too early" to comment on what impact the scandal and recall will have on sales in the market. According to MainFirst analyst Alain Oberhuber, Maggi sales comprise around 29% of Nestle sales in India. The loss of this revenue stream would represent a "significant hit" to Nestle in the country.\r\nKepler Cheuvreux analyst Jon Cox believes the issue could affect Nestle''s total organic growth in the current quarter. "India is a small part of group sales... [but] India is a major growth driver (particularly given weakness elsewhere in BRICs and emerging markets) and we presume the issue could knock ten to 20 basis points from Nestle’s organic sales growth in Q2, which we already expected to be a somewhat soft quarter," he wrote in an investor note.\r\nThe issue could also prove detrimental to Nestle''s broader strategy in the Indian market. According to Euromonitor International analyst Lianne van den Bos, India is an important country for Nestle''s Maggi brand, representing its second-largest market with retail revenue of US$263m.\r\n"Nestle’s strategy in India has been to provide affordable products that cater to a wide consumer base (including tier three and four cities). By building a strong image in an affordable product such as noodles, Nestle has been able to broaden the Maggi brand’s remit, and extend into products with higher margins such as cooking sauces and meal solutions for the more affluent consumers. This strategy has, however, been dependent on the trust that consumers have in Maggi and this is what is at risk," van den Bos noted.\r\nAnother risk factor for Nestle is the scandal could spill over into other international markets. Singapore has already moved to block the sale of noodles imported to the market from India while the UK has confirmed it is testing Maggi noodles for lead and MSG.\r\nNevertheless, commentators by and large believe the issue will be a short-term bump in the road for Nestle. Pundits have highlighted Nestle''s strong food safety and compliance record, on the one hand, and the short memories of consumers, on the other.\r\nAs van den Bos summed up: "This scandal is very damaging for Nestle in the short run as it affects its whole business strategy in India. It should be pointed out, however, that Maggi has been around for a very long time in India and food scandals are frequent in the Indian market. It will not be long until another comes along and distracts consumers (and the media) from the Maggi food scandal of 2015."\r\n\r\nhttp://www.just-food.com'),

However, competition is intensifying. Dean Best spoke to Warburtons'' free-from director Chris Hook at the Free From Food Expo in Barcelona, to find out more about the group''s plans - not just in the UK but, potentially, elsewhere in Europe.\r\nBusiness at privately-owned UK baker Warburtons is dominated by conventional bakery but the company is putting increasing efforts behind its free-from unit Newburn Bakehouse.\r\nFree-from accounts for a small part of the group - around 2-3% of its annual sales - but, with the conventional bakery category one of the toughest in the country, free from is growing in importance at the company.\r\nCompetition in mainstream UK bakery is acute, with the category one of the sectors central to price competition among the major retailers. Some of the country''s supermarket chains have also been reviewing a number of categories, including bread, as they look to streamline ranges in response to the success of the discounters. In March, it emerged Tesco, which has been cutting SKUs, had delisted bread brand Kingsmill, owned by Associated British Foods.\r\nConventional bread is a tough place to do business in the UK and, to varying degrees, all of the major brands are being affected. Against that backdrop, the biggest brands are devoting more attention to other segments, such as wraps, thins and, in Warburtons'' case, free-from.\r\n"I think it''s fair to say in terms of the way the main board are viewing free from, it is becoming a more important leg strategically within the business," Chris Hook, Warburtons'' free-from director, tells just-food.\r\nHook says Warburtons is set to invest in its production at its dedicated free-from bakery in north-east England. The plan, he explains, is to increase the plant''s "flexibility", partly with an eye on potentially taking the Newburn Bakehouse brand into other markets in Europe. Alongside finding "the right distribution partners", Hook says investment in production and packaging is vital for Newburn Bakehouse''s ambitions outside the UK.\r\n"There''s some investment going on currently in the bakery where we''ll be looking to upscale and invest further in the kit we are using so we can start to add longer-shelf life products to the portfolio, which will enable us to venture into mainland Europe and also just into Ireland."\r\nThere are possible avenues for brands like Newburn Bakehouse in Europe, where there is growth but where markets are less developed than the UK.\r\nHook is optimistic about the opportunities. "I think there''s a frustrated demand in Europe," he says on the sidelines of the Free From Food Expo in Barcelona. "I''ve picked up, not just last year but this year, a frustration from European retailers that they want to embrace this opportunity and provide a range of products. To date, they''ve tended to default to the principal brand - which is Schar - and I know they want to broaden the portfolio and the choice for consumers, which they are not necessarily always getting from Schar. That''s one of the key opportunities for the likes of us, [Boulder Brands-owned] Udi''s and Genius Foods to bring interesting products into Europe."\r\nWarburtons could have Newburn Bakehouse products ready to launch into other European markets in 12 months. "I''d like to think by May, June 2016 we''ll have a portfolio of products that are fit for purpose for the European market. In principle, Ireland is a key market for us going forward but we''re also acutely aware that the Italian market is one of the biggest markets and we really want to explore that opportunity. And then the German territory."\r\nA launch of Newburn Bakehouse into overseas markets would not be the first time Warburtons has made a foray outside the UK. However, the group has not found its international ventures plain sailing, with unsuccessful moves for conventional Warburtons products in France and central Europe in recent years.\r\nNevertheless, Hook says Newburn Bakehouse has the freedom to look at new markets. "Warburtons have been into Europe and then retreated from Europe and have really consolidated in the UK. The free-from business at Warburtons does have a licence to explore other channels. By using the brand Newburn Bakhouse by Warburtons, we feel that''s an ideal vehicle to explore what is fundamentally a different market. The free-from market is a different market to core bakery. We do have a licence to pursue that but we''ve got to have the right product format, that''s key for us."\r\nThe UK gluten-free category - and the bakery segment within that - continues to grow at a healthy rate. Hook says Newburn Bakehouse''s sales grew 11% last year. However, in an echo of what is being seen in conventional bakery, competition in gluten-free is heating up.\r\nHe concedes competition in gluten free in the UK is creating "some pressure" on price but says the still relatively small size of the category and the fact consumers are ready to buy "brands they trust" protects prices. "There is some pressure but fundamentally it''s still a market that will justify the current price structure. The volumes are still not at a level you''d expect with a mainstream product. The cost of manufacturing, the cost of ingredients are still high. And what we''re finding very clearly is consumers are prepared to pay more for quality. To have a product that tastes as good as a mainstream product, people will pay for that."\r\nIn the UK, looking at the free-from category as a whole, Newburn Bakehouse "held its own" last year, Hook says, "hovering around 22-23% in terms of the total bakery category". However, he adds: "In terms of bread, we''d not where we''d like to be. We realise that Genius do hold the number one position there. While that doesn''t sit comfortably with us, we appreciate they were first to market. We are looking at more innovative ways to be products to market that will challenge Genius and give the retail customer and the end-consumer a better quality product."\r\nIn April, Warburtons added "artisan", hand-made loaves to its Newburn Bakehouse range. The company launched two SKUs - a standard, white loaf and a white sourdough loaf - into Sainsbury''s and Hook says it plans to extend the line. "We''re looking to expand that range and take the quality level up to a different point so you''ve got a real premium product. I''d like to be in a position where I''m sat down with the Warburtons family where it''s hard to tell the difference between a Warburtons white loaf and one of our artisan, gluten-free loaves from Newburn Bakehouse."\r\nWarburtons is also looking to emphasise what it sees as the health credentials of its gluten-free products versus rival bread. On the Newburn Bakehouse website, in a claim dated to January, the company says its seeded farmhouse loaf has "40% lower fat than Genius’ loaf" per 100g.\r\n"Health is going to become paramount to success within the free-from category," Hook says. First and foremost, you need to be gluten-free, wheat-free and ideally dairy-free. Then you need to look at your health claims. You need to look at new ingredients, new processes to embrace healthier claims because that''s where the real growth is going to come from in terms of lifestylers. Lifestylers are looking at these products in the first instance believing they''re healthier for them but then they look at the back of pack and they realise the fat content is especially high or the sugar content is high and so, on second reading, it''s not as healthy as they first suspected. There are two key drivers for free from - one is quality and the second is the health benefits."\r\nHook declines to reveal Newburn Bakehouse''s sales figures and, as a privately-owned business, Warburtons is not bound by the reporting requirements of listed groups, making it hard to a make a calculation of the brand''s recent sales. In the last set of accounts released to Companies House, Warburtons'' company turnover was GBP562.1m (US$860.2m) for the 52 weeks to 28 September 2013.\r\nWhile the Newburn Bakehouse business generates 2-3% of Warburtons'' sales, Hook forecasts it could grow to 5-6% of group turnover by 2019.\r\nDespite increased competition in UK gluten-free bakery, there is, then, optimism of continued growth at Newburn Bakehouse domestically - and fledgling ambitions for a move into Europe.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.just-food.com'),

Both moves play into rising consumer trends of healthier eating and convenience. But with Nestle''s frozen business still reeling from the effects of a consumer shift towards fresh due to perceptions of it having greater goodness, are the moves enough to win consumers back? Hannah Abdulla explores.\r\nIn the last week, Nestle announced two step changes which affect its US frozen food portfolio, pointing to suggestions the Swiss food-maker is desperately seeking out damage control options for this pressured category.\r\nFrozen has been the laggard for Nestle for some time now. However, the chill is being felt right across the frozen category in the US. According to data from Euromonitor International, frozen processed food experienced slow growth in the years 2013-2014 of US$40.65bn to $41.99bn. In frozen pizza specifically, sales increased to $5.2bn versus $5.01bn for the same period a year earlier and in frozen ready meals, sales grew marginally to $8.33bn from $8.27bn.\r\nIt is undoubtedly a problematic situation for Nestle and the Stouffer''s owner appears torn over how to react. Nestle is the largest player in US frozen, with sales of $394m, two-and-a-half times bigger than the nearest rival. It is unsurprising it is not in a hurry to ditch its frozen business and has appeared committed to trying to "fix" the problems it is facing in frozen.\r\nOne of the brands experiencing a tough time is its frozen diet brand, Lean Cuisine. At an investor day last June, Nestle said it was preparing to step-up investment in the brand. One could argue, where Lean Cuisine is concerned, the coolness is coming from it being a "diet" brand. Frozen diet meals, according to Nielsen data, have seen a fall in value of 7% to $2.1bn.\r\nBut Nestle''s problems in frozen go well beyond just one brand. In its full year results, announced in February 2014, Nestle said while it had seen good performances in coffee creamers, super premium ice cream and PetCare in North America, growth was offset "by the continuing contraction of the frozen category". In frozen pizza it said "category dynamics" in addition to pricing "led to a disappointing slowdown".\r\nThe company is, however, still working on solutions. This week Nestle made two announcements which will impact its frozen foods business.\r\nThe first of the two changes saw Nestle commit to removing artificial flavours and cutting salt from the pizzas and snacks it sells in the US. The level of salt will be reduced by 10% compared to the amount in the products in 2013. The move will impact over 250 frozen products.\r\nIt is not the first time Nestle has made such a move . Earlier in the year, it announced it was pulling artificial flavours and colours from chocolate products in the US in response to growing demand for clean label and more natural products. But this is the first such move in its frozen business and the commitment appears to be one way of trying to amend the way consumers perceive "frozen". In recent years, frozen has been viewed by many consumers as not having the same levels of goodness associated with fresh.\r\nCEO Paul Bulcke, during the full year investor conference call, alluded to the fact Nestle would be working to change negative perceptions that had been built towards the frozen category.\r\n"Frozen is not perceived fresh, although it has all the intrinsic freshness in there... [there is] fundamental work to be done, something we started already one-to-two years ago. It is linked with the quality and the freshness of the products, with the ingredients we put in there. It is also going for the intrinsic quality of the category, and that''s why we have this campaign, Freshly Made, Simply Frozen," he said.\r\nJon Cox, analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux, says this latest move from Nestle in shouting about the health benefits through salt reduction is important for the Di Giorno owner. "Frozen is seen as long shelf life - meaning full of unhealthy things to enhance shelf life, which turns consumers off despite the convenience of the product. Nestle has to move in this direction, remove anything seen as bad and highlight the naturalness and goodness of the products in addition to the convenience."\r\nIn keeping with the push toward better-for-you the company today (5 June) announced the launch of a new range of "protein-packed" frozen meals under its Stouffer''s brand. Fit-Kitchen targets Americans that "strive to eat healthier and be healthier" suggesting Nestle is really trying to shift perceptions of being an unhealthy frozen foods maker.\r\nThe second of its big moves in frozen this week focused on convenience. In a bid to grow its presence in the snacks category, Nestle launched bite-sized versions of its Hot Pockets products. The company is selling Hot Pockets Snack Bites and Hot Pockets Breakfast Bites to tap into the fragmentation of meal times.\r\nAgain, this is not a knee-jerk reaction from Nestle. At the full year results Bulcke noted that Nestle needed to move toward the "way people want to eat" which is "more healthy snacking throughout the day".\r\nChristopher Brody, marketing manager for Hot Pockets added: "Today''s millennials aren’t sitting down to a traditional three meals a day, so the lines have become blurry between meals and snacking."\r\nSimilarly the truth of the matter is not everyone has time to cook from scratch. Such a product offers a higher level of convenience, and with Nestle''s latest commitment to cut salt, signifies the firm cares about consumer health.\r\n"When it comes to some of its frozen offerings, namely frozen pizza, savoury snacks and ready meals, the convenience angle is a given but it has to show and persuade consumers that it is taking their concerns about overly processed foods seriously," says Cox.\r\nWhether these moves to improve the health of its frozen portfolio are enough to drag the category out of the mud are only something time will tell. But its safe to assume for many of the brands within frozen, this really is last-chance saloon.\r\nAt the Consumer Analyst Group of Europe, the-then CFO of Nestle, Wan Ling Martello indicated the firm had limited patience for its US frozen business.\r\n"We''re very clear on which ones to fix quickly, if not to divest and which ones do we need to accelerate and in what brackets. We have a very clear roadmap internally," she said.\r\nAnd while it has accelerated moves in fixing certain aspects of frozen, Cox believes internally, Nestle has issued a strict timeframe as to when such moves should start boosting numbers.\r\n"I suspect that it has given local managers until the end of the year that it''s relaunch is working - otherwise you may find parts of the business are sold off," he concludes.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.just-food.com'),

Authorities in Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Tamil Nadu all confirmed elevated lead levels in Maggi noodles, the FSSAI said today (5 June).\r\nIn a meeting with the FSSAI, Nestle executives argued testing protocols "had not been followed and interpreted correctly". The company suggested the dried noodles and seasoning should not have been tested individually but should have been tested as a combined end product. Moreover, the samples collected in Uttar Pradesh were tested as a combined end product but, Nestle suggested, the sample had "remained open for a considerable period" thus tainting the result.\r\nHowever, the FSSAI rejected these arguments on the basis the seasoning and noodles are packaged separately and should therefore be tested separately. The authority also insisted no samples were tainted: "It is wrong to say that the sample remained in open condition for about two months".\r\nThe FSSAI said: "Detection of lead in a food product as a heavy metal contaminant beyond permissible levels renders the food product unsafe and hazardous." The body required Nestle to pull all nine varieties of Maggi noodles from the shelves.\r\nThe FSSAI also insisted Nestle''s labelling of products as containing "no added MSG" was "misleading" because, although the food giant does not use MSG as an ingredient, naturally occurring glutimate is present in Maggi noodles.\r\nIn addition, the FSSAI was critical of Nestle for launching its Maggi Oats Masala Noodles with Tastemaker product "without getting the product assessed for its risk / safety and grant product approval".\r\nThe FSSAI said Nestle believed the product was launched at a time when an advisory requiring approval was under stay granted by an Indian court. However, the regulator said the product was exempt from this rule because it is a "propriety food".\r\nThe FSSAI ordered Nestle to withdraw the Maggi brand and "stop further production, processing, import, distribution and sale of the said product with immediate effect".\r\nEarlier in the day, Nestle had said it is removing Maggi from shelves in India due to consumer confusion.

Elsewhere, Abbott Laboratories was tied up in a class action lawsuit over its Similac product with allegations it is misleading consumers since the product contains non-organic ingredients. Elsewhere Nomad Holdings confirmed it is in acquisition talks with Findus Group. just-food visited the Free-From Expo in Barcelona this week and spoke to Warburtons among others. We also interviewed the CEO at Divine Chocolate. Here is the week in quotes\r\n"If there is a real crisis in cocoa then it’s going to be problematic for everybody... The emphasis that we have been making is that it is incumbent on the chocolate industry to make cocoa farming worthwhile. Cocoa farmers need to earn a better income so that the next generation takes it up... The rest of the chocolate industry has been very concerned about there not being enough cocoa going forward and their focus has been increasing yield – but this is not necessarily increasing farmer income" - Sophie Tranchell, CEO at Divine Chocolate, discusses how Divine''s farmer ownership strategy allows for a more "secure supply chain".\r\n"I think there''s a frustrated demand in Europe. Also I''ve picked up, not just last year but this year, a frustration from European retailers that they want to embrace this opportunity and provide a range of products" - Chris Hook, Warburtons'' free-from director, tells just-food at this year''s Free-From Expo Warburtons is weighing up taking its free-from brand Newburn Bakehouse into Europe. \r\nThe trust of our consumers and the safety of our products is our first priority. Unfortunately, recent developments and unfounded concerns about the product have led to an environment of confusion for the consumer, to such an extent that we have decided to withdraw the product off the shelves, despite the product being safe" - Nestle withdraws its Maggi noodle brand in India over a scare that has seen local food safety bodies insist the product has elevated levels of lead.\r\n"The ... investors and companies recognise that protecting forests and upholding human rights are essential for long-term business models and, consequently, investments that depend on a resilient, sustainable natural capital base" - Food makers including Kellogg, PepsiCo and Mars call on the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil to "strengthen transparency, auditing and enforcement" among its members.\r\n"The total exports to Russia should not be affected due to the embargo and will continue to be performed by five other units in the Marfrig Beef in Brazil and four units in Uruguay, therefore there will be no impact in terms of volume and profitability" - Marfrig responds after Russia blocks meat imports from one of its plants along with three other Brazilian companies.\r\n"Obesity is a complex problem which cannot be reduced to the demonisation of one ingredient, nor can it be right that an everyday ingredient such as sugar is characterised as a poison" - Ian Wright, the UK Food and Drink Federation''s director general, responds to comments made by the National Health Service chief, Simon Stevens, that the food industry should "stop marketing junk food at children" and step up its efforts to remove sugar from processed foods.\r\n"We feel relieved that there are no casualties amongst our employees. However, this day will remain a dark page in the history of Lotus Bakeries" - Jan Boone, CEO of Lotus Bakeries, on news a fire has "completely destroyed" its production facility in Meise.\r\n"Abbott deceptively and misleadingly claimed that the infant formula is ''organic'' and charged a premium price for the ''organic'' infant formula. Abbott was also motivated to mislead consumers to take away market share from competing products, thereby increasing its own sales and profits"- A class action lawsuit has been filed against Abbott Laboratories over its Similac infant formula that alleges the US group is "misleading" consumers since the product contains non-organic ingredients.\r\n"While frozen food is regarded as a cash generator, it is also characterised by low margins.

Nomad confirmed yesterday (4 June) it is in "exclusive" negotiations over the acquisition of assets of Findus Group. The acquisition would strengthen Iglo''s hand in the European frozen food sector but, in order to seal the deal, Nomad could have to pay the piper, Katy Askew suggests.\r\nWhen Nomad announced its acquisition of Iglo Group in April, the company said it "seeks to build a portfolio of best-in-class companies and brands". This, Nomad continued, will be achieved through Iglo''s organic growth as well as M&A. "Nomad will pursue strategic and complementary acquisitions intended to enhance its consumer offering and deepen its market leadership," Nomad explained.\r\nAs M&A specialists Oghma Partners noted in their review of M&A activity at the start of 2015, the GBP1.9bn (US$2.9bn) sale of Iglo left the frozen food unit positioned as a consolidator in the European frozen food space. "There are indications that Nomad is looking to find bolt-on acquisitions for Iglo. With 90% of the frozen food market to go for in Europe, the next few years could see Iglo acting as a leading consolidator in the sector," Oghma said.\r\nCertainly, there are a number of post-Iglo acquisition targets that could pique Nomad''s interest. Glenboden M&A expert Stephan Kirk argued that there are "plenty of candidates" for Nomad to pursue in our recent M&A Watch column. Potential targets could include Kerry Group''s frozen ready meals business in the UK or Hortex in Poland. The "big one" for Iglo, however, is Findus Group, Kirk argued in April.\r\nIndeed, Nomad confirmed yesterday (4 June) that it has entered "exclusive" talks with Findus owner Lion Capital over the purchase of the group''s continental European assets and the Findus brand.\r\n"Nomad confirms that it is in exclusive early stage discussions with Findus to acquire its continental Europe business and the Findus brand," Nomad said in a regulatory filing.\r\nA spokesperson for the investment vehicle declined to comment beyond the official statement.\r\nFor its part, Findus revealed today due diligence is "currently taking place". The company detailed the scope of discussions, which include Findus Nordic (including Sweden, Norway, Finland and Denmark) and Findus southern Europe (including France, Spain and Belgium). The talks do not, however, include Young’s Seafood Ltd, Findus Group’s fish and seafood company in the UK.\r\nExpanding Iglo''s geographic reach is likely to be a key priority for Nomad. Findus'' strong presence in southern European and Nordic countries would complement Iglo''s own geographic footprint and augment its operations in markets where the business does not currently have a strong market share.\r\nBuilding scale in the frozen food sector is also likely to be key to Nomad''s business model. Frozen food is typically a strongly cash generative business but one where margin pressure is intense. For this reason, Euromonitor analyst Pinar Hosafci says, the category is well-suited to the cost-cutting nature of private equity investors.\r\n"While frozen food is regarded as a cash generator, it is also characterised by low margins. Due to storage concerns, frozen food is primarily sold in big chained retailers and discounters which typically own their own private label, exerting significant pressure on the margins of branded products. The high cost, low margin nature of the category lends itself well to private equity, where aggressive cost cutting measures can rapidly improve profitability," Hosafci notes.\r\nThe acquisition of Findus would extend Iglo''s leading share of European frozen sales. Euromonitor data suggests Iglo had a 10.3% market share in 2014, while Findus was Europe''s third-largest frozen food maker behind Oetker Groupe with a 4.4% share of sales.\r\nA combined Iglo-Findus could leverage this scale to reduce costs and drive synergies, advancing the firm''s competitive position.\r\nWhile the strategic logic behind a tie-up between Iglo and Findus is strong, both Findus and Nomad were quick to stress that a deal is far from secured. In the fragmented European frozen food sector, it seems unlikely that competition issues will block a deal altogether. So, it is likely to come down to a question of price.\r\nAccording to one industry source, Nomad could end up paying quite a premium if it is to ink a deal. "With a strong IPO market at the moment and improved quoted food ratings they may have to pay above 9 times EBITDA to get it."\r\n\r\nhttp://www.just-food.com'),

He highlighted that one child in ten is obese on starting primary school and one in five is too fat when they leave.\r\n"The task of the food industry and the retailers is to reformulate food – particularly sugar – as they have done on salt, and to recognise that they don’t want to end up on the wrong side of the public argument," he said.\r\nThe FDF''s director general, Ian Wright, in an open letter addressing Stevens'' comments said: "Obesity is a complex problem which cannot be reduced to the demonisation of one ingredient, nor can it be right that an everyday ingredient such as sugar is characterised as a poison."\r\nThe letter pointed out how FDF members have for many years "taken a responsible, proactive and collaborative approach to public health," naming Mondelez, Premier Foods and Unilever all as examples that have made changes to improve some of their foodstuffs.\r\n"We have reduced calories through recipe reformulations, including sugar and saturated fat reductions, to iconic products and changed portion sizes. In particular, through the use of low calorie sweeteners, significant reformulations have been made in carbonated beverages, dairy desserts and yoghurt, confectionery and table-top sweeteners.\r\n"We support evidence and science-based solutions in tackling the obesity challenge. Indeed when it comes to taking action on health, companies rely on government guidance to ensure they are focusing their energies and investment in work which will bring about positive change for consumer health.

(AP) -- The Cleveland Cavaliers finished off Chicago and swept past Atlanta, even when Kyrie Irving wasn''t available.\r\nNow they have to find their way past the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals without him.\r\nIrving has a fractured left kneecap and will have surgery that could sideline him for three to four months, the Cavaliers said Friday.\r\nAlready without Kevin Love, the Cavaliers are now without their All-Star point guard, who had been playing in pain for most of the postseason and was injured again in the final minutes of Game 1 on Thursday night.\r\n''''As far as how we prepare, we''ve been through this. We''ve played games without Kevin, without Kyrie,'''' coach David Blatt said Friday, before the team announced Irving''s diagnosis. ''''We know how we want to play when they''re not in there. From that standpoint, we can prepare. Our main concern right now though is just Kyrie''s health. That''s all.''''\r\nThe Cavaliers said an MRI exam Friday at Stanford Sports Medicine Clinic revealed the injury and that surgery will be performed at the Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland by Cavaliers head team physician Dr. Richard Parker.\r\n''''Saddened by the way I had to go out but it doesn''t take away from being (a part) of a special playoff run with my brothers,'''' Irving wrote in a Twitter posting. ''''Truly means a lot for all the support and love. I Gave it everything I had and have no regrets. I love this game no matter what and I''ll be back soon.''''\r\nIrving limped off the court during overtime of Cleveland''s 108-100 loss on Thursday night and left the arena on crutches. He has been bothered by foot and then knee pain for most of his first postseason, sitting out the second half of the series-clinching victory over Chicago in the second round.\r\nHe then missed two games during the Eastern Conference finals, but played well Thursday, finishing with 23 points before leaving with 2 minutes left in the extra period.\r\nMatthew Dellavedova stepped in during Irving''s absence in the last round but played only 9 scoreless minutes Thursday.\r\nLeBron James said Friday the Cavs would be prepared no matter who was available.\r\n''''Well, there are a few things that you would love to have going late in the season,'''' he said. ''''That''s being healthy, having a great rhythm, and then you need a little luck as well. We''ve had a great rhythm. We haven''t had much luck, and we haven''t been healthy. But I haven''t gotten discouraged.\r\n''''I understand the moment that I''m in, and I''m not too much worried about the game. I''m worried about the moment. I''m happy with the moment. I''m excited to be in this moment once again, and I''m going to stay strong for my team, no matter who is or is not in the lineup.''''\r\nThe Cavs have battled injuries throughout James'' first season back in Cleveland. Starting forward Anderson Varejao was lost to a ruptured left Achilles tendon months ago, then Love''s dislocated left shoulder came as the Cavs were finishing a first-round sweep of Boston.\r\nNow they are without one of the league''s dynamic performers, who had posted the NBA''s two highest-scoring games this season with 57 and 55 points, against a team that Warriors already had a decided advantage in depth.\r\n''''Well, Golden State has a very deep roster that''s been one of their strengths throughout the season.  We''ve been a team that''s been struck with injuries that has shortened ours to a certain extent,'''' Blatt said. ''''I think we did pretty good coming through that. We''re here in the NBA Finals. But certainly their depth is something that has to be reckoned with, and it''s a factor for them.''''\r\nStill, the Warriors insisted it wouldn''t make things easier as they chase their first title in 40 years.\r\n''''So we can''t assume that Kyrie plays or doesn''t play that it''s going to be a cakewalk for us to get a championship,'''' Warriors star Stephen Curry said. ''''It''s still going to be a challenge. It''s still going to be tough. We have to control what we control and do what we do.''''\r\nJames scored 44 points Thursday, his most ever in the finals. He''s dealt with having important teammates hurting in the finals, from the Cavs shutting down Larry Hughes midway through the 2007 series to Dwyane Wade''s leg injuries last season.\r\nHe said the good thing now is the Cavs were already used to playing without Irving.\r\n''''So, next man up,'''' he said, ''''and guys will be ready for the challenge.''''\r\n\r\nhttp://us.rd.yahoo.com'),

Both were part of a lineup filled with second-half substitutes.\r\n''''I was just kind of in shock,'''' Wood said.\r\nKlaas-Jan Huntelaar split the central defenders and scored on headers in the 27th and 49th minutes and assisted on Memphis Depay''s 53rd-minute goal as the sixth-ranked Netherlands built a 3-1 lead.\r\nGyasi Zardes got his first international goal in the 33rd for the U.S., which reached halftime in a 1-1 tie despite having just 39 percent possession.\r\nWood (22), Zardes (23) and Williams (26) all failed to make last year''s World Cup roster but could play a role next month at the CONCACAF Gold Cup, where the Americans hope to successfully defend their title and earn a berth in the 2017 Confederations Cup. The U.S. has another test Wednesday when it plays world champion Germany in Cologne.\r\n''''We can now counter those heavy legs that maybe some players develop after 55, 60, 65 minutes,'''' Klinsmann said. ''''That might be the difference to a year ago. We can now counter that with players that come off the bench that actually can surprise people with speed. And speed plays a big role in the modern game.''''\r\nJohn Brooks, a 22-year-old defender whose late goal lifted the U.S. over Ghana in the Americans'' World Cup opener, cut the U.S. deficit to 3-2 in the 70th minute. He stripped Huntelaar of the ball just shy of midfield, passed to U.S. captain Michael Bradley and kept on running. Bradley sent the ball wide to DeAndre Yedlin, who centered for Brooks to tap in from 6 yards for his second international goal.\r\nWilliams tied the score when Luuk De Jong headed the ball weakly following Bradley''s corner kick. Williams intercepted the clearance, and his 20-yard right-footed shot deflected in off De Jong''s outstretched left foot and the underside of the crossbar.\r\nDeJong had two great chances following the kickoff, with Brad Guzan saving an 8-yard header and DeJong knocking the rebound off the crossbar. Bradley then eluded three defenders during a 50-yard run upfield and passed ahead to Jordan Morris. The Stanford sophomore centered for Wood, who swept the ball in with his right foot from 7 yards.\r\n''''I was lucky that my shot deflected at the end,'''' said Williams, who plays for second-tier Reading in England. ''''It''s an absolutely fantastic feeling to win against Holland in Amsterdam.''''\r\nWood, whose Erzgebirge Aue club was relegated to the German third division, was making just his seventh appearance for the U.S.\r\n''''It kind of made me mentally stronger,'''' Wood said of the unsuccessful relegation fight. ''''It''s something that every player kind of has to go through. I''m happy that after that hard time I had this good time.''''\r\nThe Americans, ranked 27th, had been outscored 7-1 by the Dutch.

Fellow attacker Jozy Altidore is recovering from a hamstring injury and midfielder Alejandro Bedoya was out with a knee injury and watched from the stands.\r\nGuzan, who lost his starting job at Aston Villa in April, made his first national team appearance since November and has been announced as the U.S. starter at the Gold Cup.\r\n''''It gives us that belief that when we do play tough teams, when we do play big teams, especially in difficult venues, away from home, outside the United States, that we can go and get wins,'''' he said.\r\nNOTES: Huntelaar''s goals raised his total to 41 in 72 international matches, moving one ahead of Patrick Kluivert for second place on the Dutch scoring list.

It gave the Swede a one-shot lead going into a weekend that includes Tiger Woods.\r\nBut just barely.\r\nLong after Lingmerth capped off a bogey-free round at Muirfield Village, Woods was 40 yards away from the flag on the 18th green and in dire need of getting up-and-down to save par and avoid missing his first cut at the tournament he has won five times.\r\nFor his second straight tournament, he holed a key putt to survive.\r\n''''At least I was able to make those putts, so that''s a positive sign,'''' Woods said after his 2-under 70. ''''Now I just need to put myself in the position where those putts are to win tournaments, not to make cuts.''''\r\nHe was 11 shots behind Lingmerth, who was at 12-under 132.\r\nWoods had to hang on, making two straight bogeys before his par save on the final hole. For Jason Dufner, it was a thrill a minute.\r\nDufner made a 5 on a par 3 and a 3 on a par 5. And that was before he made a hole-in-one - his fourth eagle of the week - on the par-3 16th hole. He followed that with a bogey. It was relatively boring after that, and the former PGA champion wound up with a 67 that put him in final group with Lingmerth, just one shot behind.\r\nDufner didn''t have much to say - he rarely does, even when he won the PGA Championship two years ago - and spoke only to Ohio-based reporters. Until a tie for eighth last week at the AT&T Byron National, he had gone just over a year without a top 10 on American soil. The only time he made news was when his divorce was reported.\r\n''''I''m hitting it really good,'''' Dufner said. ''''I''m having enough good holes, good shots, to offset some of the mistakes I''ve had.''''\r\nRyan Moore, gearing up for a U.S. Open near his hometown outside Tacoma, Washington, had another 67 and was at 10-under 134, along with Andy Sullivan of England, who can earn a spot at Chambers Bay with a good week at the Memorial.\r\nA trio of past champions - Hideki Matsuyama, Jim Furyk and Justin Rose - were in the group that was three shots behind. Joining them was Patrick Rodgers, who made eight birdies in a round of 66 and is poised to at least secure temporary membership on the PGA Tour.\r\nGood scores were stacked up behind them. There were plenty of birdies available on a course that still presents trouble around every corner.\r\n''''Every shot gets your attention,'''' Rose said.\r\nIt got the attention of Masters champion Jordan Spieth. He went out in 31 and was creeping up on the lead when he wound up on the wrong side of the 10th green and made double bogey, and he never recovered. Spieth missed a half-dozen putts from 10 feet or in and had to settle for a 70 that put him six shots behind.\r\nPhil Mickelson made a late eagle for a 68 and was in the group at 4-under 140.\r\nKenny Perry made bogey on his last hole for a 73 and missed the cut by one shot. The 54-year-old took a career money exemption for the year so he could end his career at the Memorial, which he won two times.\r\nLingmerth had missed four cuts in his last five starts, and the start of this tournament was ominous when he was 2 over through four holes. He made seven birdies on his last 12 holes on Thursday, and he made seven more Friday.\r\n''''I started giving myself some opportunities and the putts started dropping in,'''' Lingmerth said.\r\nDufner was tied for the lead late Thursday until he hit his tee shot into the water on the 18th and made double bogey.\r\nHe started Friday on the back nine and was in trouble early when he hit into the water on the par-3 12th and had to make a 4-footer to salvage double bogey. His fortunes changed quickly. He hit a wedge to 5 feet for birdie on the 14th. He hit hybrid into 6 feet for eagle on the 15th. And then he hit 6-iron into the hole on the par-3 16th.\r\nFive under on three holes goes a long way.\r\n''''Probably the best I''ve ever done,'''' Dufner said.\r\nWoods, meanwhile, opened with three birdies in four holes, though he was still wild off the tee. He mixed bogeys with birdies and was in reasonable shape at 3 under for the tournament until he missed the 16th green long and made bogey, and then found a deep patch of rough just off the left side of the fairway at the 17th, had to lay up and could get no closer than 30 feet from 100 yards. That bogey put him on the cut line, and he popped up his 3-wood off the 18th tee into rough.\r\nBut he saved his par and saved his weekend.\r\nThis is the third straight tournament that Woods made the cut, something he hasn''t done in a year. He believes he is making progress, though the bar has been lowered significantly at the moment.\r\n\r\nhttp://us.rd.yahoo.com'),

(AP) -- North Carolina and the NCAA appear to agree on at least one thing: The school has corrected problems that led to its long-running academic fraud scandal through numerous reforms and personnel changes.\r\nWhat the two sides don''t agree on is what rule violations were committed.\r\nThat will play a role in any potential sanctions the school could face now that the NCAA has hit the school with five charges, meaning there''s still a long road to resolution in a nearly 4-year-old case.\r\n''''We''ll do everything we can do to make it go as quickly as possible, but we''ll take the time to do it thoughtfully,'''' UNC chancellor Carol Folt said Friday. ''''But I think we all know that we will get to the end of this process. And I''m very anxious for that to take place because while this has been going on for all these years, we''ve been doing so many other things.''''\r\nThe NCAA''s notice of allegations outlined a lack of institutional control and four other potential Level I violations, which are described as a ''''severe breach of conduct.''''\r\nThe NCAA regarded issues surrounding academic irregularities within the formerly named African and Afro-American Studies (AFAM) department as potential improper benefits by saying athletes received ''''special arrangements'''' such as access to courses and other assistance generally unavailable to non-athletes.\r\nThe lack of institutional control focused on the AFAM department and the academic support program for athletes, including the conduct of a women''s basketball adviser for providing too much help on assignments. No coaches were charged.\r\nMany details followed findings from the eight-month investigation by former U.S. Justice Department official Kenneth Wainstein. His probe found the problems - most notably, lecture classes that didn''t meet and were treated as an independent study requiring a research paper or two - affected more than 3,100 students between 1993 and 2011.\r\nWainstein''s October report stated athletes made up roughly half the enrollments in problem courses typically featuring GPA-boosting grades, while also detailing how academic counselors enrolled athletes in those classes and how poor oversight throughout the university allowed the fraud to run unchecked for so long.\r\nThe NCAA didn''t charge UNC with academic fraud in its May 20 notice and limited its charge of improper benefits to between fall 2002 and summer 2011.\r\nUNC must now file its response, which includes whether it agrees with the charge level and whether the facts are ''''substantially correct.'''' Athletic director Bubba Cunningham said Thursday that ''''some (allegations) I agreed with, some I did not'''' on his first read.\r\n''''To do a thorough review, it does take time,'''' Cunningham said. ''''There''s a lot of data to review and the reviews go back quite some time. But I will also concur that it has been a difficult environment on the campus for us ... and I do think the length of time has impacted our ability to attract some of the students that would have committed to the institution in previous years.''''\r\nJust don''t expect the process to move quickly. The school is allowed 90 days to respond, which is when it would self-impose penalties if it decided to do so.\r\nCunningham said UNC would likely take the full time allowed to respond.\r\nThe NCAA''s enforcement staff would then have 60 days to file its own response. That would ultimately lead to a hearing with the infractions committee, which typically issues a ruling and any sanctions within weeks to months.\r\nThis academic investigation grew out a 2010 investigation into the football program, with the committee issuing sanctions in March 2012 in that case roughly nine months after the notice of allegations arrived. A similar timeline would carry this case through at least February 2016 - approaching six years since the NCAA first arrived on campus.\r\nUNC still faces questions from its accreditation agency - which is scheduled to decide next week on any potential sanctions - and several lawsuits from ex-UNC athletes.\r\nGene A. Marsh, who spent nine years on the NCAA''s infractions committee and a former chairman, said speculating on penalties facing UNC in the NCAA case is ''''just throwing darts.''''\r\n''''I go back to the idea that people in athletics only find somebody to do this dance I''d call it ... if they find some partner on the other side - somebody to dance with,'''' said Marsh, a former faculty athletic representative at Alabama. ''''And that''s the academic side of the aisle.\r\n''''So it is different and it''s broader in that it stretches over time and it affects a lot of different people, but it''s not the end of the Earth. Carolina will get past this and it''s a great academic institution. Everyone knows that. It doesn''t define the school.''''\r\n\r\nhttp://us.rd.yahoo.com'),

At 3-all in the fourth, with dark clouds moving in and light fading, they were ushered off the court. Djokovic and Murray will resume Saturday at 1 p.m. local time, a little more than 16 hours after they stopped.\r\nThe eventual winner will face a much-more-rested Stan Wawrinka of Switzerland in Sunday''s final.\r\nThe eighth-seeded Wawrinka, who eliminated Roger Federer in the quarterfinals, followed that up by defeating France''s Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 6-3, 6-7 (1), 7-6 (3), 6-4 in Friday''s opening semifinal. Wawrinka succeeded largely on the strength of one statistic: He saved 16 of 17 break points.\r\nThere were a few whistles and jeers directed at Wawrinka after he ended Tsonga''s bid to give France a men''s champion at its own tournament, something that last happened when Yannick Noah won in 1983.\r\n''''Jo is always a tough player to play,'''' Wawrinka said, ''''especially when he''s playing at home.''''\r\nThe first chants of ''''Son-gah! Son-gah!'''' accompanied by rhythmic clapping arrived before the first point was played, and they returned over and over at key junctures, as did yells of ''''Allez, Jo!'''' and other support for Tsonga that prompted the chair umpire to ask for quiet.\r\nThe temperature topped 90 degrees (32 Celsius) at Court Philippe Chatrier, and the players wrapped towels filled with ice around their necks at changeovers to try to cool off.\r\n''''Heat didn''t bother me,'''' Tsonga said. ''''My opponent made my life difficult.''''\r\nA year ago, after winning the Australian Open championship, Wawrinka lost in the first round in Paris. Now he''s into his first French Open final and second at a major.\r\nFor Djokovic, so much is at stake this weekend.\r\nFinish off Murray, and he would face Wawrinka with a chance to become only the eighth man in tennis history to own at least one trophy from each of the sport''s four most prestigious tournaments, adding to his five from the Australian Open, two from Wimbledon and one from the U.S. Open.\r\nIt would be Djokovic''s third appearance in the final in Paris.\r\nHe lost in 2012 and 2014 to Rafael Nadal, the nine-time champion whose 39-match Roland Garros winning streak was ended by Djokovic in this year''s quarterfinals.\r\nEntering Friday, Djokovic was 40-2 this season, with 27 victories in a row.\r\nHe looked like that same, dominant player for the first two sets against Murray, a two-time major champion trying to become the first British man to reach the final in Paris since 1937.\r\nBut the Serb''s form began to dip in the third set, while Murray started to play better and better and tried to rile the crowd by motioning for more support. Murray broke Djokovic for the first time to go ahead 6-5 in the third, then served that set out at love - the first set Djokovic dropped over these two weeks.\r\nAfter that, Djokovic went off the court to visit with a trainer, perhaps for treatment on the groin muscle problem he dealt with earlier in the tournament. Starting in the second set, and continuing into the third, Djokovic did deep knee bends and flexed his hips and upper legs.\r\nThe match was becoming more competitive, and the second game of the fourth set was tremendous. Djokovic held three break points, but failed to convert any. On one, a 34-stroke exchange that was the day''s longest, he put a forehand into the net. A too-long forehand ended a 28-stroke exchange on the game''s last point.\r\nThat was part of a run of nine consecutive points for Murray, who broke Djokovic at love to lead 2-1. But Djokovic is nothing if not a fighter, and when Murray dumped a forehand into the net, another break made it 2-all. Djokovic pumped his right fist and looked up at his guest box, where his wife stood, clapping and yelling.\r\nThey''ll all be back Saturday for more.\r\n\r\nhttp://us.rd.yahoo.com'),

''''I don''t think anybody accepts a job in this business without feeling ... uneasiness in terms of the result.''''\r\nSweeney spoke at a hotel in downtown Buffalo, where he and his staff are attending the NHL''s pre-draft scouting combine that concludes Saturday.\r\nHired two-and-a-half weeks ago after Peter Chiarelli was fired, Sweeney wanted to take his time and meet with Julien and his staff to ensure everyone was on the same page.\r\nSweeney, who previously worked as the Bruins assistant GM, based his decision on Julien''s past success, accountability and what he termed the ''''structure'''' of his coaching philosophy.\r\nJulien has a 351-192-79 record with Boston, and has a 470-278-10-102 career record that includes his previous stints in Montreal and New Jersey.\r\nHe now has the longest active tenure with a single team among NHL coaches, after Mike Babcock left Detroit to coach the Toronto Maple Leafs last month.\r\nThe Bruins were eliminated on the final day of the regular season, and finished ninth in the Eastern Conference standings, one spot out of the playoffs.\r\nThe Bruins (41-27-14) were undone by a rash of injuries and an aging roster last season. The team also had difficulty making roster changes as a result of a payroll that nudged against the salary cap. Rather than adding talent, Boston was forced to free up space by trading key defenseman Johnny Boychuk to the New York Islanders before the start of the season.\r\nWithout going into detail, Sweeney noted that he has some decisions to make regarding the team''s roster before the NHL''s free agency period begins on July 1. And he added, Julien will have input on those decisions.\r\n''''We do have to move a little bit in a different direction. And we''re at a bit of a crossroads in that regard,'''' Sweeney said.\r\nSweeney also challenged Julien and his staff to make some changes to their approach.\r\nBelieving the Bruins were too defensive-minded last season, he urged Julien to focus on developing more of an attacking style of system based on a faster transition.\r\nSweeney was running out of time and options if he intended to change coaches, with the NHL draft only three weeks away and the free-agency period opening on July 1.\r\nMany of the top established candidates were taken off the market by teams filling their vacancies the past few weeks. Aside from Babcock, the Buffalo hired Dan Bylsma, Edmonton hired Todd McLellan and San Jose chose Peter DeBoer.\r\n---\r\nAP Sports Writer Jimmy Golen in Boston contributed to this report.\r\n\r\nhttp://us.rd.yahoo.com'),

(187, 'News', 'http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/topNews/~3/k-NNZK5AHmc/story01.htm', 'Robust U.S. jobs report boosts chances of Sept Fed rate hike\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON U.S. job growth accelerated sharply in May and wages picked up, signs of strong momentum in the economy that bolster prospects for a Federal Reserve interest rate hike in September.\r\nNonfarm payrolls increased 280,000 last month, the largest gain since December, the Labor Department said on Friday.\r\nWhile the unemployment rate rose to 5.5 percent from a near seven-year low of 5.4 percent in April, that was because more people, including new college graduates, entered the labor force, indicating confidence in the jobs market.\r\n"Today''s strong jobs report shows that the underlying trend in the economy is continuing to improve. This leaves the Fed on course to start hiking rates in September," said Michelle Meyer, senior economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York.\r\nThe report joined May automobile sales and manufacturing data in suggesting economic activity was gaining traction after a slow start in the second quarter.\r\nDoubts had sprung up in financial markets over whether the Fed would be able to raise rates this year after a first-quarter contraction in GDP and a string of weak data in April, including soft figures on consumer spending and industrial production. \r\nThe jobs data helped dispel those doubts. The dollar raced to a 13-year peak versus the yen and surged against the euro. Prices for U.S. government debt fell sharply, with the yield on the two-year note rising to a more than four-year high. \r\nStocks on Wall Street ended mostly lower.\r\nAverage hourly earnings, which had long been the missing piece in the jobs recovery and one closely watched by Fed policymakers, rose eights cents. In addition, payrolls for March and April were revised to show 32,000 more jobs created than previously reported, giving the report a healthy glow.\r\nTraders in futures markets brought up their expectations for a rate hike to October from December. Fed officials, who have kept overnight borrowing costs near zero since December 2008, meet on June 16-17 to plot their course.\r\n\r\nGAINING MOMENTUM\r\n"First-quarter GDP is looking even more anomalous, and some of the recent growth concerns should be mollified by the latest job growth figures," said Michael Feroli, an economist JPMorgan in New York. \r\nEconomists had forecast payrolls rising 225,000 last month, with the unemployment rate steady. May''s payroll gains lifted job growth above last year''s average of 260,000 jobs per month. \r\nDespite May''s rise in the jobless rate, it remains not too far from the 5.0-5.2 percent range that most Fed officials consider consistent with full employment.\r\nPolicymakers will also be encouraged by the return of some discouraged job seekers to the labor market.\r\nThe labor force participation rate, or the share of working-age Americans who are employed or at least looking for a job, increased 0.1 percentage point to 62.9 percent, a four-month high. The number of discouraged workers in May was the lowest since October 2008, and the percentage of the working-age population employed hit its highest level since June 2009.\r\n"These formerly frustrated workers are returning to the labor force as a pick-up in hiring activity and record-high job openings have been increasing their chances of finding a job," said Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit Research in New York.\r\nIn May, 28.6 percent of the unemployed had been out of work for 27 weeks or more, the lowest rate in six years. A broad measure of joblessness that includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment was unchanged at 10.8 percent. \r\nLast month''s increase in average hourly earnings took the year-on-year gain to 2.3 percent, the largest rise since August 2013. The mix of jobs gains and higher wages lifted the aggregate weekly payrolls index, a proxy for take-home wages, 0.5 percent in May and 4.9 percent over the year.  \r\nFurther gains are expected given firming demand for entry-level workers and a better composition of jobs that are being created. In addition, many states have raised the minimum wage and some corporations are increasing pay for workers.\r\nWalmart (WMT.N), the largest private employer in the United States, this week announced it would raise minimum wages for more than 100,000 U.S. workers, its second wage hike this year. \r\nPayroll gains last month were broad-based, though the mining sector purged jobs again as it continued to work through the thousands of cuts announced by oil-field companies. The 18,000 mining jobs lost in May marked a fifth straight monthly decline. \r\nAmong sector heavyweights, Schlumberger (SLB.N) has announced about 20,000 layoffs this year, while Baker Hughes (BHI.N) and Halliburton (HAL.N) are also cutting thousands of jobs.\r\nManufacturing employment increased 7,000, while construction employment payrolls rose by 17,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n (Reporting by Lucia Mutikani; Editing by Andrea Ricci and Tim Ahmann)\r\n\r\nhttp://feeds.reuters.com'),

Officials initially blamed a faulty power transformer at the rally site but later ruled that possibility out. \r\nEyewitness Guy Martin, a British photographer, told Reuters the blasts occurred some five minutes apart - the first in a rubbish bin which was ripped apart and the second in front a power generator. In the aftermath he saw one person who had lost a leg and others with shrapnel wounds.\r\n"It was a heart-shaking, ribcage-shaking noise, he said of one of the blasts. "The most terrifying thing is that crush of people. It was chaos, I couldn’t move, people were panicking."\r\n"The police started firing teargas at people who were helping the injured or fleeing the scene this enflamed the situation," he added. "The mood is angry. People want revenge."\r\nThe explosions killed two people and injured more than 100, Erdogan said in an interview with broadcaster ATV, having earlier expressed condolences for the victims.\r\n"It is very important that all our citizens are careful in the face of provocations like this aimed at undermining our democracy, the atmosphere of peace and brotherhood in our country," he said in a statement.\r\nTensions have run high as the HDP campaigns to become the first party with Kurdish origins to win seats in parliament in Sunday''s election. Previously, Kurdish MPs have joined the legislature as independents.\r\nThe HDP needs to overcome a 10 percent vote threshold, and some opinion polls show it could seize enough seats to deprive the long-ruling AK Party of the majority it has enjoyed since sweeping to power in 2002.\r\n\r\nPOLICE FIRE WATER CANNON\r\nHDP Chairman Selahattin Demirtas called on his supporters to remain calm.\r\n"We don''t know the cause of the blast," he told CNN Turk. "It is thought-provoking that this occurred so close to the election," he added.\r\nTelevision footage showed people carrying the injured on stretchers as organizers of the rally for the pro-Kurdish HDP announced on loudspeakers that the explosion had been caused by a fault in a power generator and urged people to stay calm. \r\nThe explosion rocked the parade ground just before Demirtas was to address the crowd. Police fired water cannon to disperse protesters who remained at the parade ground. The rally was subsequently canceled.\r\nSecurity has been tight at HDP political rallies. On Thursday, nationalists clashed with HDP supporters at a Demirtas rally in the northern town of Erzurum.\r\nDemirtas has said his party has been the target of more than 70 violent attacks during the campaign.\r\nErdogan, who used to head the AK Party, has accused the HDP of being a front for the Kurdistan Workers'' Party (PKK), which took up arms in 1984 in an insurgency that killed 40,000 people. \r\nJailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan and Ankara launched peace talks more than two years ago. \r\n\r\n (Writing by Ayla Jean Yackley, Humeyra Pamuk, Daren Butler; Editing by Nick Tattersall and Angus MacSwan)\r\n\r\nhttp://feeds.reuters.com'),

By backing away now, he hopes to build support in Congress for maintaining his original, tougher language. \r\n    Having fast-track negotiating authority in place would allow Obama to negotiate the TPP, which links a dozen countries and covers 40 percent of the world economy, knowing Congress only has a yes-or-no vote and could not pick the deal apart.\r\nThe White House is working with Republicans on a legislative sleight-of-hand that would allow the House to vote on the fast-track bill containing the tougher language, betting it would be overridden by softer language in companion trade legislation.\r\nBut opposition from Menendez - an influential voice on foreign affairs who backed two of three major trade deals in 2011 - and other lawmakers could make that more difficult. \r\nMost of Obama’s Democratic Party and some Republicans oppose  fast-track.\r\nHouse Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi supports the original language and says it is "an important step in advancing the debate over human rights as the TPP is negotiated," her spokesman said. \r\n    The Malaysia revelations come as the U.S. State Department prepares to release its annual human trafficking scorecard this month and decide whether to keep the country at Tier 3 following a downgrade last year. \r\n    The discovery of the graves puts pressure on the State Department to keep Malaysia on Tier 3, but it is no sure bet it will. The State Department draws a distinction between smuggling and trafficking. Smuggling, done with the consent of those involved, differs from trafficking, in which people are trapped by force or deception into labor or prostitution.\r\n    The graves were found in an area long known for the smuggling of Rohingya and local villagers reported seeing Rohingya in the area, but Malaysia''s Deputy Home (Interior) Minister Wan Junaidi Tuanku Jaafar has said it was unclear whether those killed were illegal migrants or legal foreign workers.\r\n            \r\n    "THE MALAYSIA FIX"\r\nThe State Department would need to show that Malaysia has neither fully complied with minimum anti-trafficking standards nor made significant efforts to do so to justify keeping Malaysia on Tier 3.\r\n    Malaysia has an estimated 2 million illegal migrant laborers, many of whom work in conditions of forced labor under employers and recruitment companies in sectors ranging from electronics to palm oil to domestic service.\r\nAn administration official said a major cause of the trafficking problem in Malaysia related to foreign workers who are subject to forced labor and debt bondage, and the White House was working closely with the Malaysian government and stakeholders to fight the problem.\r\n"TPP is on track to require signatory countries to address forced labor through enforceable labor provisions, which would be a major step forward in regional and international efforts to address this problem," the official said. "Further, we are working with Malaysia on specific actions to help ensure that it can meet this commitment.”\r\nAmong the 12 TPP countries, Brunei has also come under attack by human-rights groups for adopting Islamic criminal law, which includes punishing offenses such as sodomy and adultery with death, including by stoning. Vietnam''s Communist government has been criticized for jailing dissidents. \r\n    The trade battle could peak in the deeply divided House in  mid-June if Republican House Speaker John Boehner estimates there are enough votes to pass a bill that he favors.\r\n    For many wavering lawmakers, the main worry is the economic impact the deal would have on their home districts.\r\n    Behind the scenes, House Republican leaders and the White House, which sees trade deals as a way to engage trading partners in debate on issues such as human rights, have worked hard on what some were calling "the Malaysia fix" to soften the language.\r\n    The Republican chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Paul Ryan, said the original language would unfairly punish other TPP partners, such as Japan and Australia, and the issue was best dealt with in a customs enforcement bill that is intended to move through Congress along with fast-track.\r\n    "We shouldn’t confer Malaysia’s sins to these other countries that we’re trying to get agreements with,” he told reporters.\r\nDavid Abramowitz, a vice president with the human rights group Humanity United, said he wanted to see the exact language on this issue that House Republican leaders intend to attach to a customs enforcement bill.\r\nHis organization supported the compromise worked out in the Senate. "I believe that this approach is a positive step forward in that it requires real action by Malaysia" or other countries that may be involved in future trade agreements, Abramowitz said of the Senate language.\r\nBut some House Democrats said neither the original Menendez language nor the compromise version is enough.\r\n    "Congress should insist that Malaysian laws and practices change to meet international standards before we vote on TPP," said Sander Levin, a senior House Democrat.\r\n\r\n(Paragraph four incorrectly said Menendez was the senior Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

His popularity has faded this year, and a tie-up with center-right Macri could strengthen the opposition.\r\nA Massa spokesman said all options remained on the table. Macri''s camp dismissed talk of a deal.\r\n"They have already given all they have to give. We''re betting on individuals who have no connection with the running of the country in recent years to lead Argentina with fresh ideas," Macri''s campaign office said in an emailed comment.\r\nMassa pitches himself as a centrist within the broad Peronist movement that has ruled Argentina for all but eight years since the return of democracy in 1983. But his campaign is faltering. \r\nMassa has burned bridges with Fernandez loyalists, while many opposition and swing voters still associate the lawmaker with Fernandez''s turbulent years in power. Some senior officials in Massa''s Front for Renewal have defected back to the ruling coalition.\r\nAn opinion poll by Management & Fit in late May showed Scioli and Macri running neck and neck, almost 20 points ahead of Massa, who had 13.8 percent of voter support. In December, Management & Fit had Massa within 7.5 percent of Scioli.

Many Massa voters could switch their support to Scioli rather than back a non-Peronist.\r\nMacri "wants to run as a pure opposition candidate and represent a ''new political'' movement," said Daniel Kerner of Eurasia Group.\r\n\r\n (Additional reporting by Nicolas Misculin; Editing by David Gregorio)\r\n\r\nhttp://feeds.reuters.com'),

A total of 103 bodies have been found.\r\nFrustration over the lack of information has grown among families of the missing. Seventy-year-old Xia Yunchen burst into a just finished news briefing with senior officials on Friday, screaming and demanding answers.\r\n"Is it necessary to treat the common people, one by one, as if you are facing some kind of formidable foe?" said Xia, whose sister and brother-in-law were aboard the Eastern Star.\r\nXia, from the eastern city of Qingdao, told reporters she had wanted to get into the news conference to hear for herself what the government was saying, and that she wanted an honest investigation because family members doubted the weather was the real cause of the disaster.\r\n"You view the common people as if we are all your enemy. We are tax payers. We support the government. You had better change your notion of this relationship. You are here to serve us. You need to be humane," Xia said, before being escorted out.\r\nPolice then kept reporters back behind a closed gate while they moved away relatives and passersby on the street outside.\r\nAbout 1,200 relatives have converged on Jianli county in Hubei province where the disaster happened.\r\n"My most important hope in coming here is still the same - to lay eyes on my mother," said Zhang Junmin.\r\nAnother relative, who asked not to be identified, sent a Reuters reporter a picture from their hotel room showing three police cars parked outside, by way of explaining why they were too nervous to meet.\r\nAware of the sensitivity of the disaster, the ruling Communist Party''s Politburo Standing Committee, China''s apex of power, called on local authorities to take measures to help grieving families and to "earnestly safeguard social stability".\r\n\r\n"NO COVER-UP"\r\nRescuers, many from the military, worked through the night to right the four-deck ship.

Officials noted extensive, previous arms transfers under different U.S. authorities.\r\nIraq''s Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi laid bare his frustrations at a gathering in Paris this week, saying Baghdad had received "almost none" of the promised international assistance.\r\n"They''re complaining the program is too slow. But the fact is it''s a slow system," said Douglas Ollivant, a former Iraq adviser in the Obama and Bush administrations. \r\nBy contrast, he added, "they tell the Russians they want fighter planes and they show up in a month."\r\nThe first U.S. material provided to Iraqi forces under ITEF outfitted an Iraqi army brigade with rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers, mortars, protective masks and other gear. \r\nAnd more arms were on the way, Pentagon spokeswoman Commander Elissa Smith said. \r\n"This is the first of several planned unit equipment issues\r\nfor the coming weeks, which will include Peshmerga units," said\r\nSmith, referring to Kurdish forces. \r\nShe said the first issue of equipment from the fund to Iraq''s army occurred the week of May 18th, the same week that Ramadi fell to Islamic State, handing the Iraqi military its biggest defeat in nearly a year. A delivery of AT-4 anti-tank weapons last weekend also came from the fund, she said.\r\n"We are, in terms of ITEF, still close to its starting point," a U.S. government official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.\r\n\r\nDELIVERIES SEEN AS TOO SLOW \r\nA Pentagon document completed last year detailed plans for\r\nITEF to provide a host of U.S. equipment, ranging from 45,000 pieces of body armor for Iraqi forces to 14,400 M4 rifles for Kurdish forces. Sunni fighters would get 5,000 AK-47 assault rifles. (Click 1.usa.gov/11nsTuN to read the document.)\r\nU.S. officials acknowledge that a big test of the program will be getting the Shi''ite-led government in Baghdad to arm Sunni tribes, a crucial step, they say, toward reconciliation.\r\nWhile arms are just part of a broader U.S. effort that includes air strikes, training and surveillance, the Iraqis see the pace of the weapons flow from Washington as one of the few measurable gauges of President Barack Obama''s commitment to the fight - and they say the deliveries are too slow. Obama has already ruled out any major deployment of "boots on the ground." \r\n    Still, some U.S. officials feel that Abadi''s complaints about weapons and other assistance broadly reflect domestic pressure, particularly after the fall of Ramadi last month. \r\n"He''s feeling pressure from all sides," one official said.\r\nThe Pentagon has cited coalition deliveries of tens of millions of rounds of ammunition and hundreds of vehicles to Iraq since last summer. The bulk of these were provided through different authorities than ITEF, such as coalition donations and traditional foreign military sales.\r\n"A lack of weapons and ammunition is not the central problem," said a U.S. military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, citing instead "vulnerabilities in organization and leadership" of Iraq''s security forces. \r\nU.S. officials appeared to play down concerns about whether Iraq would be able to secure newly-provided weapons, after abandoned U.S.-provided arms and vehicles repeatedly ended up in Islamic State hands over the past year.\r\n"Loss of weapons is an inherent risk when arming an allied military during active conflict," the military official said.\r\n\r\n (Reporting by Phil Stewart; Editing by Tom Brown)\r\n\r\nhttp://feeds.reuters.com'),

She was shot in the head and airlifted to Britain for treatment, where she now lives. Two other schoolgirls were also wounded.\r\nMalala became a global symbol of defiance after she campaigned for girls'' education despite Taliban repression and she won the 2014 Nobel Peace prize. \r\nSenior police official Salim Khan said the eight men were freed because there was not enough evidence to connect them to the 2012 attack. \r\nPolice had said in April that all 10 had been convicted and jailed for 25 years each in a trial held behind closed doors. It was not clear why officials had given incorrect information. \r\n"The only reason for their release was lack of proof against them," Khan said. \r\nProsecutor Naeem Khan said the men had confessed to the court that they had helped plan the attack. \r\nNone of the accused were suspected of being the gunmen, who security officials believe fled to Afghanistan. \r\n"During the trial, all the 10 persons had admitted and confessed their role in Malala''s attack before the judge of the anti-terrorism court. But only two of them, Izhar Khan and Israrullah Khan, were convicted while the remaining eight were freed," Khan said.\r\nHe said the trial had been conducted inside the main prison in Swat Jail after militant threats. \r\nKhan said he filed an appeal against the acquittal on May 18 but the men had already been freed on April 30.\r\nThe case will raise further questions over police competence, accountability and secret trials in Pakistan.\r\nPolice are poorly trained and equipped. Most officers have never been trained in how to gather evidence and rarely follow basic procedures such as securing crime scenes. Cases mostly hinge on highly unreliable oral testimony, leading judges to frequently dismiss charges involving major militant attacks. \r\nTrials are often held behind closed doors because judges, lawyers and witnesses fear retribution from militants. \r\n\r\n (Writing by Katharine Houreld; Editing by Gareth Jones)\r\n\r\nhttp://feeds.reuters.com');
